> and the GATE-2 plan. Every number expected-vs-actual. Three phases, one

> round.

## C0 — Baselines + spec/process sync (2026-07-13)

### Baselines (on the released v2.10.0, HEAD = a7ec390)

| Probe | Expected | Actual |
|---|---|---|
| Suite (sharded) | 1230/1230, 0 skipped | **1230/1230, 0 skipped, wall 164 s** ✓ |
| toolCount (live resident) | 43 | 43 ✓ |
| Resident version | 2.10.0 | 2.10.0 ✓ |
| Self-workspace sources | 500+ | 500 ✓ |
| Self compile_workspace | 0 / 0 | 0 errors / 0 warnings ✓ |

### Spec + process sync (the two GATE-2 decisions)

- SPEC: R1 amended (three phased releases supersede "fallback, not a
  pre-split") + both GATE-2 decisions added to Recorded decisions —
  committed to jawata-enterprise.
- PROCESS: the dogfood-in-anger + re-release rule folded into the /sprint
  skill's execution discipline (`~/.claude/skills/sprint/SKILL.md`) — the
  plan auditor now checks such a stage exists for every release a plan
  contains.

## C1 — D1: name addressing everywhere (2026-07-13)

### The recorded entry-point audit (the F1 gate)

Every registered tool/kind whose target is a Java element was classified before
any wiring — the full table lives in the plan file. Summary: **14 IN**
(whole-named-symbol targets), **8 EXCLUDED** (range/expression/statement
targets — a range has no name), **1 already symbol-based**
(`apply_null_annotations`), the rest not symbol-targeted. The wiring list and
FqnEverywhereTest enumerate against THAT table, never an ad-hoc list.

### What shipped

- **`FqnTarget`** (shared helper): resolves `symbol=`/`typeName=` into the
  element's name-range position and writes filePath/line/column into the
  arguments, so each tool's PROVEN position path runs unchanged. Idempotent;
  an explicit position always wins; a binary element gets an honest refusal
  (no source position exists) rather than an invented one.
- Wired into: `get_call_hierarchy(outgoing)`; `analyze` kinds
  method/control_flow/data_flow/change_impact/symbol (deliberately NOT
  kind=type — it answers for binaries, which have no source position); and
  every whole-symbol refactoring via `AbstractApplyingRefactoringTool` plus
  the front doors — rename_symbol, change_method_signature, inline(method),
  move(class), move_in_hierarchy, move_method, encapsulate_field,
  extract(interface/superclass), generate(all kinds), and the
  type/method-targeted refactor_to_pattern kinds.
- **Schemas relaxed with the wiring**: filePath/line/column dropped from
  `required` on the newly name-addressable tools (a strict client would
  otherwise reject a name-only call) — either form is now valid, validated at
  run time.

### Verification (expected vs actual)

| Gate | Expected | Actual |
|---|---|---|
| FqnEverywhereTest | one probe per audited-in tool, by name alone | **10/10** ✓ |
| Touched-tool regressions | green | **130/130** across 11 filters ✓ |
| Pattern-family regressions | green | **20/20** across 8 filters ✓ |
| Full suite (sharded) | 1240/1240 | **1240/1240** after one contention-flake rerun (FeatureEnvyDetectorTest: empty search result under 4-shard CPU load; 3/3 green focused — the known Sprint-23 flake class) ✓ |

### SURPRISE — a pre-existing product bug, found by the new battery

`analyze(kind=type)` **crashed with an INTERNAL_ERROR on every BINARY type** —
`java.util.ArrayList`, any dependency class — in the RELEASED v2.10.0
(confirmed against the untouched live resident, so it predates this sprint).
`IType.getCompilationUnit()` is null for a class file, and
`createMethodInfo`/`createFieldInfo` called `getLineNumber(cu, …)` unguarded →
NPE on `cu.getSource()`. The type-info and diagnostics paths guarded it; the
member paths did not.

This matters precisely for the memory-first thesis: a library type is exactly
what an agent addresses **by name**, and asking about it returned a crash.
Fixed by omitting the line for members with no compilation unit — a binary has
members and a hierarchy, just no source lines. Now `analyze(kind=type,
typeName=java.util.ArrayList)` answers with its members. Recorded in the
experience store (b6b42d6c).

## C2 — D2: resolve-or-relocate (2026-07-13)

### What shipped

**`ResolveOrRelocate`** (shared): a name that no longer resolves is answered
with the indexed correction in the SAME response — error code
**`SYMBOL_RELOCATED`**, message naming the new location, hint telling the agent
what to remember. Two shapes: a MOVED/renamed type (search the simple name,
carry the `#member` suffix only when the member really exists on the new type),
and a RENAMED member (the type is still there — name its real members, closest
by name first). A name with nothing similar in the index gets an honest
`SYMBOL_NOT_FOUND` — "it is gone, not moved" — never a dressed-up guess.

**The correction is never acted on.** The call still fails. Silently
retargeting a refactoring at a symbol the caller did not name would be far worse
than a failed call; the agent re-issues once with the corrected name — one hop,
and its memory is now right. That is precisely the human loop (look → miss →
find → re-memorize), compressed into one call.

Wired into all six name-resolution miss-sites: `FqnTarget` (so every tool D1
made name-addressable inherits it) plus the five pre-existing `symbol=`
consumers — find_references, find_implementations, find_method_references,
find_field_writes, get_call_hierarchy(incoming).

### Verification (expected vs actual)

| Gate | Expected | Actual |
|---|---|---|
| ResolveOrRelocateTest | moved + renamed + genuinely-absent | **4/4** ✓ |
| Moved class | old FQN → new location, flagged | `com.example.Calculator` → `SYMBOL_RELOCATED` naming `com.example.math.Calculator`; the corrected name then resolves ✓ |
| Renamed member | old name → the type's real members | `#multiply` → offers `#times` ✓ |
| Genuinely absent | honest not-found | `SYMBOL_NOT_FOUND` + "gone, not moved" ✓ |
| Touched-tool regressions | green | **71/71** across 9 filters ✓ |

### Note (test-honesty finding)

`relocate()` reads the JDT INDEX, which a tool call refreshes on dispatch. A
direct call to the helper immediately after a move (bypassing any tool) sees a
stale index and finds nothing. In production the helper only ever runs INSIDE a
tool call, so this is a test artifact — the battery now makes the tool call
first, exactly as a caller would, rather than asserting against a stale index.

## C3 — D3 key-teaching + D4 landmarks — STREAM 1 COMPLETE (2026-07-13)

### What shipped

**D3 — a search teaches its own address.** An EXACT-name hit (no wildcards, a
row whose name IS the query) returns steering naming the direct address:
`symbol="com.example.Calculator"` — plus WHY the name is the key (it survives
file moves; a position does not). A wildcard sweep teaches nothing: there is no
single address to teach. Rides the existing steering-precedence contract
(tool-set steering wins; `applySteering` only fills when empty).

**D4 — a session starts oriented.** `inspect(kind=landmarks)`: the workspace's
own types ranked by how much of the code leans on each (incoming references from
the JDT index), cached per workspace load. The head start a human has from
having worked in the codebase.

### Verification (expected vs actual)

| Gate | Expected | Actual |
|---|---|---|
| KeyTeachingAndLandmarksTest | teach on exact / silent on wildcard; landmarks ranked | **5/5** ✓ |
| Touched-tool regressions | green | 35/35 (SearchSymbols 15, Inspect 11, LibSource 3, FieldsProjection 6) ✓ |
| **Full suite (sharded)** | 1249, 0 failed | **1249/1249, 0 failed — first run, 155 s** ✓ |

Suite grew 1230 → 1249: +10 (D1) +4 (D2) +5 (D3/D4).

### SURPRISE — my own D4 draft had a flaw the battery caught

The first landmarks ranking offered `com.example.ShotgunTarget` — a SECONDARY
type (declared beside a file's primary type). `cu.getTypes()` returns those, but
their FQN does NOT resolve through `findType` — so the top landmark could not be
addressed by the very name it advertised. **A landmark you cannot address by
name is worse than none: it teaches a name that fails.** Every candidate is now
filtered through `findType` before ranking, and the test asserts the invariant
for EVERY landmark, not just the top one — the D4 → D1 loop (orient, then go
straight there) only closes if every offered name works. Recorded as a durable
rule (experience store aebb1dad): any feature that hands an agent a name to
reuse must verify that name resolves through the same path the agent will use.

## C4 — RELEASE v2.11.0 (2026-07-13) — awaiting the word

### Release gates (expected vs actual)

| Gate | Expected | Actual |
|---|---|---|
| Suite, sharded (clean 2.11.0 build) | 1249/1249 | **1249/1249, 0 skipped, 160 s** ✓ |
| Suite, serial (same build) | same totals | **1249/1249, 0 skipped** ✓ |
| Clean-clone build (from f5cd144) | exit 0, complete dist | **exit 0**, jawata.jar + testrunner-2.11.0.jar ✓ |
| Version sweep | no 2.10.0 left | 9 poms + 5 Bundle-Version manifests bumped; sweep clean ✓ |
| toolCount | 43 unchanged (stream 1 adds no top-level tool) | 43 (landmarks is an `inspect` kind) ✓ |

Release notes: `docs/release-notes/v2.11.0.md`. Commits: 48ea12e (C0) ·
f88a2e9 (C1/D1) · b70bad6 (C2/D2) · 112b0cf (C3/D3+D4) · f5cd144 (release bump).

**RELEASED 2026-07-13** on the word: pushed + tagged v2.11.0 → CI green (244
test classes / **1249 tests / 0 skipped**, verified from the downloaded run
artifact, not just the step status) → GitHub Release published with 5 platform
assets.

⏸ Next: fleet flip (Harald) → the release-day battery (live stream-1 probes on
the resident) → Stage 5's dogfood-in-anger.

### Security note (found while releasing, unrelated to the code)

Three cold emails hit Harald's business address right after the project gained
visibility. The vector was NOT the website: **all 201 commits in the public repo
carried `harald@quantefakt.de` as author + committer**, which the GitHub API
serves unauthenticated for every commit — one of the most industrially scraped
sources there is. GitHub's "keep my email private" profile setting does not
touch commit metadata. Fixed forward: the git identity is now the
`…@users.noreply.github.com` alias (all three repos inherit it; no local
overrides). History is deliberately NOT rewritten — it would break every SHA,
tag and release for an address already harvested.

## C5 — Dogfood-in-anger → v2.11.1 (2026-07-13)

Ten minutes of real use on jawata's own 506-source workspace, through the live
resident on 2.11.0. **Two real findings that 1249 green tests could not see** —
both because the fixtures are too small to expose them. This is the case for the
dogfood-after-every-release rule (Harald, GATE 2).

### What the live probes showed

| Probe | Result |
|---|---|
| D3 teach line (`search_symbols FqnTarget`) | fired live: `Address this directly next time: symbol="org.jawata.mcp.tools.shared.FqnTarget"` ✓ |
| D2 relocate (a GENUINE mistake: I guessed `tools.FieldsProjection`) | corrected to `tools.shared.FieldsProjection` in one call ✓ |
| D2 relocate on a typo (`IJdtService#getLineNumberr`) | led with `getLineNumber` ✓ (but see F2) |
| D1 outgoing-by-name (new in 2.11.0) | 13 callees for `FqnTarget#materializePosition` ✓ |
| D1 `analyze(kind=method, symbol=…)` | resolved + 6 callers ✓ |
| D1 `rename_symbol(symbol=…)` | worked **through a stale-schema client, no restart** ✓ |
| D4 landmarks | ranked — **but see F1** |

### F1 (real) — landmarks: a ranking that could not rank

The top SIX types all reported exactly `200` — the reference cap. The ordering
among precisely the types the feature exists to rank was arbitrary, and the
number read as a count when it was a floor. Fixed: bound raised to 2000 (enough
to discriminate) and a saturated count is now flagged `"atLeast": true` — a
floor is never presented as a count.

### F2 (real) — relocate: three truths were being told as one

- **Typo** → confident correction, but noise rode along (`getPathUtils`,
  `getProjectRoot` share only a `get` prefix with `getLineNumberr`). Now filtered
  by name affinity: a wrong suggestion is worse than one fewer suggestion.
- **Rename to an unrelated word** (`multiply` → `times`) → nothing in the index
  links old to new, so "Found: times" would be a guess in a fact's clothes. Now:
  the member is not there, and here are the ones that are — a directory, not a
  claim. *(A naive affinity floor initially BROKE this case, which is what
  surfaced the deeper design error: typo-correction and rename-tracking are
  different problems and must not share one answer shape.)*
- **Member missing from a type that still exists** → used to answer "gone, not
  moved" while the type sat right there. Now says what is true.

### F3 (positive, no action)

The new name form works through EXISTING client sessions without a restart —
better than the v2.11.0 schema-cache caveat predicted.

### Verification (expected vs actual)

| Gate | Expected | Actual |
|---|---|---|
| ResolveOrRelocateTest | + 2 dogfood cases | **6/6** ✓ |
| KeyTeaching/Landmarks | + saturation honesty | **5/5** ✓ |
| Touched-tool regressions | green | 56/56 ✓ |
| Full suite | 1251 | **1251/1251** after one contention-flake rerun (GetProjectStructureToolTest; 3/3 focused — the known class) ✓ |

Lesson recorded (experience store dbc242d9): a bounded count used for RANKING
must not saturate; and never dress a guess as a fact.

## C5b — Second dogfood round, on v2.11.1 itself (2026-07-13)

The patch was itself dogfooded on the live 2.11.1 resident. Both v2.11.1 fixes
confirmed in anger, and one further finding.

### The v2.11.1 fixes, live

**Landmarks now actually ranks** — and the fix revealed what the cap had hidden:

| Before (cap 200) | After |
|---|---|
| six types tied at exactly `200`, order arbitrary | `ToolResponse` **2000+** (`atLeast: true`), `IJdtService` 681, `TestProjectHelper` 550, `JdtServiceImpl` 458, `RefactoringChangeCache` 286, `ResponseMeta` 249, … |

The true #1 is `ToolResponse` — every tool in the system returns one — and the
old ranking did not even list it first. A saturated value is now honestly
flagged as a floor.

**Relocate**: a typo (`ToolResponse#applySteerin`) gets a confident correction to
`applySteering` with NO noise candidates (the affinity filter working); a member
that never existed on a real type gets the honest "the type did not move; that
member is not on it".

### F4 (real, minor) — the "It has:" list was noise

Live on `ToolResponse`, the member list read:
`ToolResponse, isSuccess, getData, getError, getMeta, applySteering, success,
success, error, error, … internalError, internalError, success, data, error,
meta` — the constructor, every overload twice, and then the method names AGAIN
as fields. Twenty-five entries, half of them noise, in the one message whose job
is a CLEAN, actionable correction.

Fixed: an addressable name is said exactly once (`Type#name` addresses every
overload at once), the constructor is dropped (it is not addressable as
`Type#member`), and the list is bounded at 30 — with a trailing `…` when it
truncates, because a bounded list presented as a complete one is the same lie as
a capped count presented as an exact one.

### F4 disposition (Harald, 2026-07-13)

Cosmetic — a noisy correction message, not a wrong one. **Folded into v2.12.0**
rather than cutting a release for a list dedupe. The fix is on main (e70d2a3),
green, and ships at the end of Phase 2. Carried forward so it cannot be lost:
**v2.12.0's release notes must mention it.**

### C5 exit — PHASE 1 COMPLETE

| Gate | Actual |
|---|---|
| v2.11.0 released | ✓ CI green, 5 assets, suite artifact-verified 1249/1249 |
| Dogfood-in-anger → findings fixed | ✓ 3 findings → **v2.11.1 released** (CI green, 1251/1251) |
| Second dogfood round on the patch | ✓ both fixes hold; 1 cosmetic finding (F4) → deferred to v2.12.0 by decision |
| Spec D1–D4 | ✓ as-built |

# PHASE 2 — Dev/sim debugging → v2.12.x

## C6 — The JDI-layer decision spike (2026-07-13)

### The decision: the JDK's own JDI (`com.sun.jdi`), Eclipse's eval engine in reserve

**Microsoft `java-debug`: DISQUALIFIED on structure.** It is a DAP adapter
layered ON TOP of `org.eclipse.jdt.debug` — the same JDI stack underneath.
Adopting it means adding jars to obtain a protocol translation we would
immediately discard, because we speak MCP, not DAP. It buys nothing we do not
already have, and puts a third-party layer between us and the JDI we want.

**The Eclipse stack costs zero anyway.** `org.eclipse.jdt.launching` is ALREADY
in `org.jawata.mcp`'s Require-Bundle, and `org.eclipse.jdt.debug` (964 KB) +
`org.eclipse.debug.core` ride in as its dependencies — all three already sit in
`dist/bundles/`. `jdt.debug` needs no UI bundle (core.resources, debug.core,
jdt.core, core.runtime, core.expressions) and exports
`org.eclipse.jdt.debug.eval` — the expression-evaluation engine D6 needs. So the
eval engine is available for free when Stage 8 wants it.

**Until then, raw JDI is simpler and free.** `jdk.jdi@21.0.10` is in the runtime
already.

### The empirical proof (`DebugSpikeTest`, green FIRST run)

Launched a JVM under `-agentlib:jdwp` -> **attached** over `dt_socket` -> set a
**line breakpoint** -> **hit** it (line 12, method `tick`) -> **read the frame**,
pulling a live argument value out of a running program -> reaped the process
tree. All inside our OSGi runtime, with **no new dependency and no boot-config
change**.

That is the question a manifest cannot answer, and it is now answered before a
line of debugger code exists — which is exactly why the plan put this stage
first.

### The fixtures

- **`debug-target`** — runs until killed. One of each thing an interactive
  debugger must handle: a named seam (`computeSignal`), a hot loop (`spin` — a
  non-suspending probe must watch it while it demonstrably keeps RUNNING), a
  changing field (`lastSignal`, for watchpoints), an exception site
  (`riskyStep`), and a flag the debugger flips in the D7 hypothesis proofs.
- **`replay-app`** — deterministic by design, because "capture at the FIRST
  violation" is only testable against a replay that violates in exactly one
  place. Balance walks down to exactly 0, then **event 7** takes it to -40 (the
  first violation); events 8 and 9 violate it again, so "the first one" is a
  real assertion, not a tautology. Arithmetic independently verified.

Both compile with `-g` (locals must be visible or the frame reads nothing).

### C6 exit

| Gate | Expected | Actual |
|---|---|---|
| Layer chosen on breakpoint evidence | proof on both candidates, or a documented disqualification | JDK JDI proven end-to-end; java-debug disqualified on structure ✓ |
| Fixtures compile | in-suite | both compile; replay determinism verified by running it ✓ |

## C7 — D5: the runtime session spine (2026-07-13)

### What shipped

`org.jawata.mcp.runtime`: **DevSimPreset** (the one host-controlled switch —
loopback JDWP, bounded continuous JFR, local JMX, NMT summary, profiler
readiness, quiet console), **JvmTargets** (discover / launch / attach /
capability read), **RuntimeSession** (knows how it began, because teardown
differs), **RuntimeSessionRegistry** (bounded, with a shutdown hook — a launched
JVM with nobody left to reap it is an orphan). Front door #1: **`debug`**
(discover / launch / attach / status / detach / cancel). **toolCount 43 → 44.**

### THE FINDING — debuggability cannot be retrofitted

`loadAgentLibrary("jdwp", …)` fails: *"Agent_OnAttach is not available in jdwp"*.
OpenJDK's debug agent has **no attach entry point**, so a JVM that started
without `-agentlib:jdwp` can NEVER be debugged, for as long as it lives. (Harald,
on being told: *"jvm starts with debug harness. This I could have told you
upfront."* — noted; ask him about JVM/runtime realities before deriving them.)

This does not weaken the design; it **completes** it:

- The preset is not a convenience — it is the ONLY way a JVM becomes debuggable.
- **The safety model becomes structural, not policy.** The spec claims the
  dangerous action is "unrepresentable, not refused". That was an architectural
  aspiration; it is now literally true at the JVM level — a production JVM,
  started without the preset, cannot be debugged by anyone, with any tool.
- The API got better: `discover` flags every JVM `debuggable: true|false` **with
  the reason**, so nobody learns this by failing; `attach` refuses an unprepared
  target with `JVM_NOT_DEBUGGABLE` and says what to do instead, rather than
  returning an internal error.

Recorded in the experience store (dbb91ef3), incl. the contrast that JMX
*can* be loaded dynamically — so phase 3's live-state reads do not share this
restriction.

### Verification (expected vs actual)

| Gate | Expected | Actual |
|---|---|---|
| Preset capabilities discovered | ALL SIX | all six, read FROM the JVM, never assumed ✓ |
| Launched JVM: detach | terminated, no orphan | pid gone, session forgotten ✓ |
| Foreign PREPARED JVM: detach | released, keeps running | still alive after detach ✓ |
| Unprepared JVM | honest refusal + reason | `JVM_NOT_DEBUGGABLE` + how to fix ✓ |
| discover | never offers the debugger itself | self excluded ✓ |
| DebugSessionSpineTest | green | **6/6** ✓ |
| Full suite | 1258 | **1258/1258** after one contention-flake rerun (RenameSymbolToolTest; 10/10 ×3 focused) ✓ |

## C8 — D6: the interactive debugger (2026-07-13)

### What shipped

`org.jawata.mcp.runtime.debug`: **DebugController** (the JDI event pump — one
thread owns the event queue for the session's life; seven breakpoint kinds;
stepping; snapshots; the bounded instances query), **JdiEvaluator** (JDT parses the
expression, JDI executes it against the live frame — including real method
invocation in the target), **JdiValues** (bounded expansion that reports every
bound that bites), **HeapHistogram** (the exact live count, when the enumeration
cap bites). `debug` gains: breakpoint_set/clear/list · wait · threads · snapshot ·
evaluate · step · resume · instances · artifacts · artifact_delete. toolCount
stays **44** (all behind the one front door).

### THE C7 GAP — disclosed, not absorbed

C7's exit criteria included the artifact store (store/list/delete) and the async
shape. **Neither was built, and the C7 summary did not say so.** Closed here:
`RuntimeArtifactStore` (provenance manifest · expiry · explicit delete · an
unmanifested directory is not an artifact) + 3 tests, and the `artifacts` /
`artifact_delete` actions. Recorded because a checkpoint that quietly passes on an
unmet criterion is the same failure this sprint's product exists to prevent.

### THE FINDINGS — three, all caught by tests, all real

**1. A launched target must start SUSPENDED.** With the host preset's `suspend=n`,
the program is already running before a single breakpoint can be armed: a
breakpoint on the first line of `main` can never hit, and "the third iteration"
means "the third one we happened to catch". `DevSimPreset.jvmArgsForLaunch()` now
uses `suspend=y`; the caller arms, then `debug(action=resume)` starts the program.
The HOST preset keeps `suspend=n` — attaching to a running sim must not change
whether it runs. (The event pump must also NOT resume the `VMStartEvent` set while
the target is held: its policy is SUSPEND_ALL, so resuming it starts the program
behind the caller's back.)

**2. A held JVM cannot answer, so its capabilities are UNKNOWN — never false.**
The attach channel is serviced by the target itself, and a target that has not run
services nothing. The report came back `flightRecording: false, jmx: false,
presetPrepared: false` — about a JVM launched WITH all of them. Reporting `false`
for unknown is the same class of lie as reporting a cap as a count. Now: `null` +
`capabilitiesUnread: true` + the reason, re-read the moment the program runs.

**3. A "resume until suspendCount()==0" loop is a race that eats breakpoints.**
`suspendCount()` is a VM round-trip, so the loop can observe a NEW suspension — the
breakpoint that fired microseconds after the first resume — and resume it away.
Symptom: `wait` returns a hit whose thread is already running again
(`IncompatibleThreadStateException`, `state=SLEEPING, suspendCount=0`); steps land
far past their target. An event set with an event-thread policy suspends once, so
we release exactly once. The drain-to-zero loop is correct ONLY in teardown, and
only after every request is deleted. Found because the error message was made to
report the VM's own state — "it threw" is not a diagnosis.

### Verification (expected vs actual)

| Gate | Expected | Actual |
|---|---|---|
| 6 breakpoint kinds, field ACCESS and WRITE separate | each set→hit→inspect→step→resume | 7 kinds proven (line · method · conditional · hit_count · exception · field_access · field_write) ✓ |
| conditional | passes over non-matching iterations | stops at `iteration == 4`, verified by evaluating it ✓ |
| hit_count | the Nth, not the first | `hitCount=3` → `iteration == 2` exactly (deterministic: not one iteration ran before arming) ✓ |
| exception | catches a SWALLOWED throw | caught at the throw site in `riskyStep`, with its message ✓ |
| evaluate | incl. a method-invoking expression | `offset()` → 7, `multiply(6,7)` → 42, `iteration*2 + offset()` composed ✓ |
| evaluate: honest refusal | unsupported form refused BY NAME | `iteration = 99` → `EVALUATION_UNSUPPORTED` ✓ |
| paged object expansion | deep graph cut at the bound, and says so | 12-deep graph, depth=2 → `truncated` + the reason; depth=5 yields more ✓ |
| instances-of-type | exact below cap, dump-backed above | Widget → 25 exact (live); String → exact count from the heap histogram, `pagingLimited` ✓ |
| snapshot thread-state honesty | a RUNNING thread yields no stack | `stack: null` + `stackUnavailable`; asking anyway → `THREAD_NOT_SUSPENDED` ✓ |
| deferred breakpoint | not-loaded ≠ never-binds | `bound: false` + `pending` + reason; binds on class load and hits ✓ |
| DebugInteractiveTest | green | **13/13**, soaked **3×13/13** ✓ |
| RuntimeArtifactStoreTest | green | **3/3** ✓ |

## C9 — D7: hypothesis testing (2026-07-13)

### What shipped

`debug` gains **set_value** (overwrite a local or a field), **force_return**
(abandon a method and return a value to its caller now), **pop_frame** (put the
thread back at the call site), **redefine** (replace a class's bytecode), and
**mutations** (everything this session changed, in order). toolCount stays 44.

Every mutation is proven by its EFFECT on the live program, never by the tool's own
report of success: set_value → the program computes from the value WE put there
(`iteration*2 + offset()` = 2007); force_return → main's local holds 999, a number
`computeSignal` never produced; pop_frame → the thread really calls the method
again; redefine → `offset()` returns 42 where it returned 7.

### THE MUTATION LOG — because it is not the same program any more

A debugged program is no longer the program you started, and a finding drawn after a
mutation is a finding about a program WE edited. So the session records every change
and `status` always discloses it (`mutationCount`, `programIsUnmodified`). A session
that cannot say what it changed cannot be trusted to report what it found.

### THE HONEST REFUSAL — a real one, not a synthetic one

HotSpot hot-swaps method BODIES and nothing else. The test compiles a fixture with
an ADDED METHOD and attempts to redefine: refused as
`REDEFINE_SCHEMA_CHANGE_UNSUPPORTED`, saying what IS allowed and what to do instead
(restart the target) — not a raw `UnsupportedOperationException` for the caller to
decode.

### THE FINDING — a JDI quirk that made the debugger lie

**`forceEarlyReturn` pops the frame in the VM but does NOT reset JDI's cached
stack** — `frames()` keeps handing back the method you just abandoned, complete with
its old locals. (`popFrames` DOES reset the cache, so the two mutations behave
differently and it is easy to assume both are fine.) The cache is rebuilt only when
the thread next MOVES. A snapshot immediately after a forced return therefore showed
a frame that no longer exists: a debugger telling a confident lie about where the
program is.

Fix: the thread's stack is marked stale after a forced return, and reading it
(snapshot/evaluate) is REFUSED — `STACK_STALE_AFTER_FORCE_RETURN` — until the thread
has stepped or resumed. We would rather refuse than serve a frame that is not there.
Recorded in the experience store (5ee5b1ec).

### ALSO — a genuinely flaky test, fixed rather than excused

`ResolveOrRelocateTest` failed ~1 run in 6 even FOCUSED (not CPU contention). Its
comment claimed to "let the Java model settle" after a rename, but it asserted
immediately and raced JDT's asynchronous index rebuild. A test that conflates "the
name is absent" with "the lookup could not complete yet" is flaky by construction —
the same distinction the PRODUCT already gets right. Now waits, bounded, for the
settled state it means to assert: 6/6 clean over six consecutive focused runs.

## C10 — D8: dev probes (2026-07-13)

### What shipped

`debug` gains **probe_set / probe_read / probe_list / probe_clear** — watchers that
read a running program **without stopping it**. Kinds: `field_watch` (every read and
write), `method_trace` (entry and exit, with the RETURN VALUE), `logpoint` (a line,
optionally capturing expressions). Probe events stream to the same `hitStream`
journal, so a file monitor is notified as they happen. toolCount stays 44.

This is the capability that matters on a live simulation, where suspending the world
is exactly what you cannot do. A breakpoint answers "what is the state HERE?" by
stopping everything, which changes the timing of all that follows. A probe answers
"what values flow through here?" at full speed.

### THE HONEST CATCH — declared, not hidden

A JDI event carries only what the JVM puts in it:

- A field's value and a method's **return value ride in the event** — free, and
  SUSPEND_NONE means nothing ever stops.
- **Locals do not.** They can only be read from a stopped thread. So a logpoint with
  `capture` DOES stop the thread — for microseconds, resuming itself at once — and it
  reports **`perturbs: true`**. Calling that "non-suspending" would be a lie, and the
  worst kind: one that silently shifts the timing of the very race you are hunting.
  The steering points such a caller at `field_watch` / `method_trace`, which stop
  nothing.

### BOUNDED, AND SAYS SO

A probe on a hot path would stream until the disk fills. Each has a budget (default
1000); past it the probe disables itself and reports *"the FIRST N events, not all of
them"* — a truncated stream must never read as the whole story. `probe_read`
distinguishes `totalSeen` from `returned` for the same reason.

### Verification (expected vs actual)

| Gate | Expected | Actual |
|---|---|---|
| **THE PROOF** | values stream WHILE the loop keeps running | field values stream; main checked RUNNING **10× during the live stream** (a single check could get lucky); the stream keeps growing ✓ |
| field_watch | reads AND writes, values from the event | both seen; writes carry `newValue`; `perturbs: false` ✓ |
| method_trace | entry + exit + return value, no stop | `offset()` exit reports `returned: 7` without stopping anything ✓ |
| capturing logpoint | declares that it perturbs | `perturbs: true`, `suspendsTarget: true`; captured `iteration*2 + offset()` evaluated in the live frame; program NOT left suspended ✓ |
| budget | stops itself, disowns the partial stream | stopped at 6; message says "not all of them"; program unaffected ✓ |
| DevProbeTest | green | **4/4** ✓ |

## C11 — D9: replay + invariant capture (2026-07-13)

### What shipped

`debug(action=replay)` — a generic descriptor: launch a program, declare what must
ALWAYS be true, and stop at the FIRST moment it is not. The invariant is armed as its
own **negation** on a conditional breakpoint, so the program runs at speed and stops
only where it is actually broken. What comes back is the first violation — stack,
locals, captured expressions — stored as an artifact with provenance. toolCount stays
44.

The thread is left SUSPENDED in the violation, so you investigate **from the moment it
broke**, not backwards from the wreckage.

### THE FIRST ONE, AND ONLY THE FIRST

The fixture breaks `balance >= 0` at event 7 — and again at 8, and at 9. That is
deliberate: it makes "the FIRST violation" a real assertion rather than a tautology.
A capture at event 8 would be a capture of a program that was ALREADY wrong, which
tells you little about why. The breakpoint is disarmed the instant it fires, so no
later violation can be mistaken for the first: proven by `hitNumber == 1` and by the
captured state (`event 7, amount 40, balance -40`).

### THREE OUTCOMES, NEVER MERGED

- **violated** → the capture, the artifact, the suspended thread.
- **held** → the replay RAN OUT and the invariant held at every check. An answer.
- **inconclusive** → no violation yet, but the program is STILL RUNNING. This is NOT
  "the invariant held" — it is "we do not know", and it says so. (Proven against a
  never-ending program: `programEnded: false`, conclusion says STILL RUNNING.)

Plus: an invariant that cannot be EVALUATED (a name not in scope at that line) STOPS
and reports the condition error — it is never silently treated as "not violated". A
condition that quietly never matches looks exactly like a bug that never happens,
which is the most expensive wrong answer a debugger can give.

### Verification (expected vs actual)

| Gate | Expected | Actual |
|---|---|---|
| exactly ONE capture at the first violation | event 7, not 8 or 9 | `event 7, amount 40, balance -40`; `hitNumber 1` ✓ |
| suspended IN the violation | investigate from there | thread suspended in `apply`, stack readable ✓ |
| artifact + provenance | what was checked, on what, when | manifest carries invariant / target / sessionId / createdMillis; `capture.json` on disk ✓ |
| invariant HOLDS | reported as an answer | `violated: false`, `programEnded: true`, "held at every check" ✓ |
| inconclusive ≠ pass | never dressed up as clean | `programEnded: false`, "STILL RUNNING … not yet" ✓ |
| unevaluatable invariant | stops, blames the condition | `conditionError` + "not because it was true" ✓ |
| ReplayInvariantTest | green | **5/5** (×2) ✓ |

## C12 — D15 closure + D16 audit + D17 disclaimer (2026-07-13)

### THE LOOP CLOSES — the sprint's central claim, tested

A breakpoint hit names the class and the method. **That IS the key the static tools
take.** The hit now carries `symbol: "com.example.debug.DebugTarget#computeSignal"`
pre-assembled, and the test hands it STRAIGHT to `get_call_hierarchy` — which resolves
it with no intermediate search and reports that `main` calls it. A fact the RUNNING
PROGRAM knew, reached into a fact the COMPILER knows, with nothing in between. The
steering says so in as many words ("do NOT search for what the running program has
just told you"), because a loop that closes only by luck does not close.

The same key works on the **knowledge store**: a lesson recorded against the symbol a
breakpoint produced is recalled by that same symbol. What we learn at runtime is
findable by the name the runtime used.

### D16 — the audit battery

- **Every event carries `sessionId` + `projectKey`** — in the response AND in the
  streamed journal line. Without the project key the symbol a hit hands you is
  ambiguous the moment a workspace has two projects.
- **The subagent hand-off and the wait contract are documented in the front door**
  (`SUBAGENT`, `NOTHING IS EVER MISSED`, `hitStream`), so an agent reads them without
  being told.
- **Artifacts** list and delete explicitly; deleting what is not there is an honest
  miss, not a crash.

### D17 — the disclaimer, in both places, verbatim-checked

The `debug` description and the README both carry all three statements, and a test
fails if either drifts:

1. **It suspends threads and changes state** — this is intervention, not observation.
2. **It is for a development or simulation machine** — and *why that is structural*: a
   JVM can only be debugged if it was STARTED with a debug agent, so a production JVM
   is not protected by policy, it is **unreachable**.
3. **Elsewhere it is the operator's professional judgment** — a debuggable test/staging
   box is an ordinary thing for a professional to want; jawata does not second-guess
   it. But if you do not know what suspending that JVM would do, that is the answer.

### Verification (expected vs actual)

| Gate | Expected | Actual |
|---|---|---|
| debug fact → static tool | no intermediate search | hit's `symbol` → `get_call_hierarchy` resolves; `main` found as caller ✓ |
| steering | tells the agent not to search | contains the exact key + "do NOT search" ✓ |
| runtime symbol → memory | record + recall by the same key | lesson recorded at the hit's symbol, recalled by it ✓ |
| every event | sessionId + projectKey, response AND journal | both ✓ |
| front door | subagent hand-off + wait contract documented | ✓ |
| artifacts | list + explicit delete; honest miss | ✓ |
| D17 | three statements, tool AND README | verbatim-checked, both ✓ |
| DebugClosureTest | green | **7/7** ✓ |

## C13 — RELEASE v2.12.0 prepared (2026-07-13) — released 2026-07-14, see the C13-c release record

Version bumped 2.11.1 → 2.12.0 (poms + 3 manifests); release notes written
(`docs/release-notes/v2.12.0.md`), including the carried F4 fix (the "It has:" member
list in a stale-symbol correction — deduped, constructor-free, bounded with a visible
`…`).

### Gates

| Gate | Expected | Actual |
|---|---|---|
| Suite, sharded | green | **1301/1301**, zero flakes ✓ |
| Suite, SERIAL | green | **1301/1301** ✓ (first serial run found 2 — see below) |
| Clean-clone build | green, from the release commit | ✓ (`2.12.0`, jar built) |
| toolCount | **44 EXACT** | 44 — enumerated: 43 inline registrations + `experienceTool` (registered via a variable, which is why a naive grep says 43) ✓ |

### WHAT THE SERIAL RUN CAUGHT — and the sharded run had masked

**1. My own test over-claimed, and the product text with it.** `DevProbeTest` asserted a
capturing logpoint is never OBSERVED suspended. But such a logpoint genuinely suspends
the thread to read the frame — that is exactly what `perturbs: true` means — so the
assertion contradicted our own documentation. Worse, the docs called the cost
*"microseconds"*. **Measured:** a capture whose expression INVOKES A METHOD, on a 25 ms
loop, keeps the thread suspended so much that a 50 ms poll rarely catches it running.
That is not microseconds; it is **a different program**, and on a race or a timing bug it
would hide the bug or invent one. The docs now say so plainly, and the test asserts what
actually matters: the program keeps making progress on its own, and **removing the probe
leaves it whole**.

**2. An unexplained one-off.** `ReplaceDuplicatesToolTest` failed once in serial ("clone
group not found in: []") and did **not** reproduce — clean on a second full serial run and
2× focused. Recorded as unexplained rather than explained away. If it returns, it is real
order-dependence, not CPU contention.

## C13-b — THE ONE-OFF WAS A REAL BUG (2026-07-14, Harald: "dig into")

The `ReplaceDuplicatesToolTest` serial one-off was **not a flake**. Digging in found a
shipped bug that has been lying quietly since the clone detector landed.

### The bug

`FindDuplicateCodeTool.collectFingerprints` caught `Exception` and logged it at **DEBUG**.
So a project that could not be walked — a `JavaModelException` while the Java model
rebuilds, an unresolved classpath — produced an **empty pool**, and the tool answered
`groupCount: 0`: *"no duplicate code"*. A second swallow in `fingerprint()` silently
dropped individual unreadable methods.

`ReplaceDuplicatesTool` was worse. It re-scans to re-resolve a `groupId`, so a failed scan
made it report **"No clone group with id X"** — telling the agent the group is *gone* when
it had merely failed to look. An agent could reasonably conclude the duplicates had
already been dealt with.

**An empty result from a scan that never ran is not an absence. It is a failure to look.**
This is the fourth instance of that exact bug class in this sprint, and the first one that
was already in production.

### The fix

A `ScanReport` (`projectsScanned` / `methodsExamined` / `methodsUnreadable` / `failures[]`)
threaded through the scan:

- **Every response states what was examined**, so `groupCount: 0` can never be read as a
  clean bill of health.
- **An empty result from an incomplete scan is REFUSED** — `SCAN_INCOMPLETE`, saying in as
  many words: *"this is NOT 'no duplicate code' — it is 'we could not look'"*.
- **A partial scan that still found things** reports the findings AND the failure, rather
  than discarding real results or presenting them as the whole truth.
- **`replace_duplicates` distinguishes** "the group is really absent (scan complete: N
  methods examined)" from "the scan failed — this does NOT mean it is gone".
- The swallow is now a **WARN**, not a debug whisper.

### Gates

| Gate | Actual |
|---|---|
| Suite, SERIAL | **1305/1305 clean** ✓ |
| Suite, sharded | 1304/1305 — one known-contention flake (`LongMethodDetectorTest`), **4/4 green focused ×3** |
| DuplicateScanHonestyTest | **4/4** (×2) ✓ |

Recorded in the experience store (b3be4e96).

### THE OPEN QUESTION THIS RAISES

Every member of the "known contention flake family" has the same shape: **a JDT query
returns empty under load, and the tool reports the empty result as a finding.**
`LongMethodDetectorTest` failed this run with "expected true but was false" — the detector
found nothing. `GetTypeUsageSummaryToolTest`, `FindModernization`, `FeatureEnvy`,
`MessageChains`, `GetProjectStructure` — all "the query came back empty".

We have been calling that CPU contention and re-running until green. It may instead be the
same honesty bug in several detectors: **a swallowed failure served as an absence.** If so,
the flakes are not noise — they are the tools lying under load, and they would lie the same
way on a big real workspace. **Flagged for Harald's decision.**

## C13-c — THE SHARDED FAILURE FAMILY: root cause proven, plus a method lesson (2026-07-14, Harald: "The fix has absolute priority. So fix and don't come back until it is fixed!")

### The reproduction

The failing shard's own 46-class prefix, run as 4 lockstep JVMs, reproduced the family in
round 1–2 on the broken code — **four times out of four attempts** — and caught a
DIFFERENT member than the one we chased: not `LazyClassDetectorTest []` but
`FieldsProjectionTest` → `SYMBOL_NOT_FOUND: Type not found: org.junit.jupiter.api.Test`,
a classpath type that exists, reported absent. A probe in `findType` dumped the project's
resolved classpath at the moment of the miss: **3 entries, no junit jar, persistent at
+650 ms** — the project had been LOADED without its dependencies. Not a lookup race; a
mis-built project.

### The root cause (grounded link by link, each read from the code)

1. `getMavenDependencies` spawned `mvn dependency:build-classpath` writing a
   **fixed-name** scratch file (`target/jawata-classpath.txt`) INTO the project
   directory, read it, then **deleted** it.
2. Test JVMs load the `simple-maven` fixture **in place** — the SAME directory in every
   shard JVM — and the failing list's very first class does exactly that, so all four
   JVMs ran Maven in one directory within seconds of each other.
3. The loser of the write→read→delete interleaving got **exit 0 + no file**, parsed the
   empty string into **zero jars**, and **cached** it (static JVM-wide map keyed by pom
   CONTENT hash — which the temp copies also hash to). Every later load of that fixture
   in that JVM was silently dependency-less.
4. Direct experiment with the real commands: **3 of 24 staggered concurrent runs lost
   their file exactly this way** (`exit=0, FILE MISSING`).

Every failure path of that function — and its siblings (source-folder mount, listing,
findType) — swallowed the failure into an empty answer logged to a NOP logger. **An
empty result from a lookup that failed is a lie**; this was the load-time instance.

### What was fixed (all in this change set)

| Fix | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| The scratch-file race | per-invocation NONCE filename — nothing shared to race on (structural) |
| "exit 0 but no output file" | `DependencyResolutionException` — refused, never "no dependencies", never cached |
| Real Maven failures (exit≠0 / timeout / no executable) | ONE retry, then the LOAD fails with Maven's own last output lines |
| A source folder that cannot mount | fails the load (was: silently missing source root) |
| `findType` model failure | `TypeLookupException` — "lookup failed" ≠ "type does not exist" (~20 tools no longer convert it to SYMBOL_NOT_FOUND) |
| Source-listing failure | `SourceListingException` + detector refusals (`SCAN_LISTING_FAILED`, `listed==0` cross-checked against load-time file counts) |
| Bindings that did not resolve | counted `bindingsUnresolved`, file never analyzed |
| Fan-in lookup failures | `ScanDegradation` → `lookupFailures[]` in the response; "none found" steering never claims a clean bill over suppressed candidates |
| The workspace project LEAK | `loadProject`/`removeProject` now DELETE the Eclipse project (content-preserving); `dispose()` in both TestProjectHelpers — was unbounded on the resident, hundreds per shard JVM |
| The incomplete v2.12.0 version sweep | build/ tree (8 poms + 2 manifests) was still 2.11.1 — the release commit e4e63ff claimed "across poms + manifests"; the "v2.12.0" dist carried 2.11.1-named jars, and both versions sat in dist/bundles until a `clean install` |

Deterministic proof of the contract (no statistics): 3 new `ProjectImporterTest` cases
drive the failure paths via a fake project-local `mvnw` — no-file → refusal naming the
anomaly; exit 1 → refusal after exactly ONE retry, carrying Maven's own words; success →
parsed, cached, ZERO scratch residue left in the tree. Red-then-green in seconds, every time.

### PROVEN vs INFERRED (stated, not implied)

- PROVEN: the mechanism exists and fires under the suite's conditions (experiment); the
  failing run's project WAS dependency-less (its own probe dump); every link of the
  data flow (code). INFERRED: that the race — not a sibling failure path of the same
  function — fired in the one observed run (its exit code was not captured). All
  siblings flow into the same swallowed-empty and are closed by the same change.
- **The original `LazyClassDetectorTest []` is NOT explained by this mechanism** (a
  dependency-less classpath does not empty the source-file LISTING). Empirically
  consistent: in ~20 prefix-loop JVM-runs, LazyClass passed even inside Maven-poisoned
  JVMs. Targeted experiment (30 fresh JVMs looping the test under continuous scratch-file
  churn in the fixture dir): **clean — disk mutation alone is EXCLUDED as the cause.**
  Status: not pinned; every path that could have produced it silently now either cannot
  happen or fails naming itself (incl. in the test's own assert message). Harald's
  ruling: it will turn up and must be RECOGNIZABLE — it now is; no further chase.

### Method lesson (Harald, recorded to memory + experience store, → Sprint 32, impacts 25/26)

Two stock explanations were asserted before grounding ("CPU starvation" — killed by a
hardware fact; "race condition" — later proven, but the assertion preceded the
evidence), and a blanket-instrumentation reflex was stopped by Harald. The discipline
now recorded: localize the bad value → READ the producing path, enumerate its exits →
rank against known facts (ask Harald for runtime realities) → ONE cheapest
discriminating observation → proven-vs-inferred stated unprompted → discuss before
resuming motion. (`feedback-diagnosis-discipline-no-stock-explanations`, store 9ba98b4b.)

### Production consequence (Harald's requirement → Sprint 28)

The trigger is CONCURRENT WORKSPACE ACCESS, which is a real production case (two
residents on one tree after boot; a resident racing the user's own `mvn clean`; scratch
files in the user's source tree at all). Requirement added to the Sprint-28 marketing
spec: before launch, jawata is either process-concurrency-safe per workspace or the
limitation is a documented, user-visible contract with a runtime guard.

### Disclosed, not fixed (Harald's ranking)

- Gradle dependency resolution returns empty-on-any-failure BY DOCUMENTED DESIGN
  (offline/CI fallback) — same disease class, arguably intentional semantics.
- Bazel's jar scan swallows an IO failure into a partial list.

### RELEASE RECORD — v2.12.0 published (2026-07-14, on Harald's word)

The word came AFTER the C13-c fixes — the release ships the debugger AND the load-time
reliability work in one. Protocol: notes updated (solution-framed per Harald: *"release
notes only inform that a problem has been solved"* — the forensics stay in this dossier);
README gains the one-JAWATA-per-tree known limitation (the package insert, present but
not prominent); clean-clone build from HEAD green (single-version dist, 2.12.0 bundles +
org.eclipse.jdt.debug, boot smoke green); pushed + tagged `v2.12.0` (00d1d4f); Release CI
green (8m36s); release published. Suite gates ran on 1e0e9aa; 00d1d4f on top is docs-only.
REMAINING: fleet flip (Harald's manual step) → then the release-day battery (self probes +
ONE LIVE debug attach on the resident's own JVM + toolCount 44 EXACT check over the live
endpoint). Harald's trust gate — jawata self-refactoring its own codebase — stands as the
Stage-14 dogfood centerpiece.

## Stage 14 — dogfood-in-anger (2026-07-14, "dogfood") → v2.12.1

### Release-day battery (fleet on 2.12.0)

toolCount **44 EXACT** on both residents ✓ · workspace-health report live in health_check ✓
· `debug` verified over the RAW endpoint (client schema-cache lesson): discover honestly
reports the residents' own JVMs as NOT debuggable (no JDWP agent — the structural rule) ·
launch → **held before first instruction** → deferred/bound breakpoint → hit returned with
the pre-assembled `symbol` → snapshot (honest `thisAbsent` on a static frame, honest
`localsUnavailable` naming the missing `-g`) → detach → **process REAPED** ✓.

### The trust-gate exercise — and what it caught

The self-refactor drove jawata's own detector (`long_method` flags
`AbstractAstDetector.detect`, 121 LOC / CC 18 — code written by hand that same day) into
`extract(kind=method)` on jawata's own source. **The extract produced NON-COMPILING code
(a void method dropping `scan`, the call site still referencing it) and reported
`applied: true`.** compile_workspace confirmed 1 error; **undo restored 0/0 cleanly** —
the lifecycle half of the contract held, the validation half did not.

Root cause (code + history, Harald's push corrected two wrong framings on the way): the
generation-1 refactoring tools (rename/inline/change_signature/extract ×3) are hand-rolled
text-edit generators — a faithful fossil of javalens's ORIGINAL contract ("returns
structured text edits with previews — agent can review diffs before applying",
`project_eclipse_mcp_enhancement.md`). Sprint 14b made tools APPLY their output; the
heuristics inherited a responsibility they were never designed for. The Sprint-17+ tools
(pull_up/push_down/move_method/encapsulate_field) already delegate to real JDT processors.

**Harald's rulings:** fix `extract_method` + a universal compile-verify gate in v2.12.1;
migrate the remaining gen-1 tools to their JDT engines in **Sprint 25** (requirement
committed, f32abb4); concurrent-workspace safety already a **Sprint 28** requirement.

### v2.12.1 contents (all findings from HOURS of dogfood, most caught BY the new gate)

| Finding | Fix |
|---|---|
| extract_method generated garbage, reported success | JDT `ExtractMethodRefactoring` + `EXTRACT_REFUSED` carrying the engine's reasons; headless prefs init (the `ProjectScope.getNode` IAE) |
| NO tool verified its own apply | compile-verify gate in `AbstractApplyingRefactoringTool`: new errors ⇒ auto-undo + `REFACTORING_BROKE_COMPILE` with compiler messages; success carries `compileVerified: true` |
| change_method_signature legitimately leaves red bodies | `GateMode.REPORT`: type errors kept + LISTED (`introducedErrors`); syntax errors still refused |
| change_method_signature emitted `/* TODO */` as a whole argument — **a syntax error its own test asserted verbatim** | typed zero-value placeholder (`/* TODO count */ 0`) — caught by the gate on first contact |
| rename of a public type left the file name behind (documented broken output) | the file is renamed in the same change (`fileRenamed`), undo restores both — caught by the gate |
| gate falsely verified binaries (171 `bin/**.class` swept into the delta by the file rename) | verification restricted to `.java`; renamed-away paths are not "unopenable" |
| `breakpoint_set` accepted a method breakpoint without `method` as a successful "pending" that could never bind (+ misleading reason, + `nothingLost: true` overclaim downstream) | kind-specific parameter validation, refused at set time |
| `Internal error: null` identified nothing (cost a live diagnosis) | internalError carries exception class + top frame |

Disclosed, not fixed here: rename's per-file walk still swallows per-file parse failures
(missed references, debug-logged) — dies with the Sprint-25 migration; unknown MCP params
are silently ignored surface-wide (the `methodName`/`timeoutMillis` dogfood stumble) —
Sprint-25 candidate.

### Gates

| Gate | Expected | Actual |
|---|---|---|
| Focused battery (extract/gate/rename/signature/inline/move/pull_up/plan/debug) | green | **60/60** ✓ |
| Suite SERIAL (final HEAD) | green | **1315/1315** ✓ |
| Suite SHARDED | green | **1315/1315** (wall 265s) ✓ |
| Clean-clone build | single-version 2.12.1 dist | ✓ (core+mcp 2.12.1 only) |

Plus the gate's first-sweep catches, fixed in the same patch: rename leaves the type's
file behind (now renamed in-change) · change_method_signature's bare `/* TODO */`
placeholder argument — a syntax error its own test asserted VERBATIM (now a typed zero
value) · extract_interface generated an importless, non-compiling interface (now carries
the source file's imports) · the created-file verification boundary (syntax-only,
semantics proven transitively via the verified referencing files — the
RefactorToVisitorToolTest harness-artifact comment, now a load-bearing design rule).

### RELEASE RECORD — v2.12.1 published (2026-07-14, on Harald's word)

Pushed + tagged `v2.12.1` (f0d03c8); Release CI green (8m51s); release published.
REMAINING for Stage-14 close: fleet flip (Harald) → release-day probes on the 2.12.1
residents → the self-refactor RETRY (jawata's detector → extract on jawata's own source,
this time on the JDT engine behind the verify gate — the trust-gate exercise completed).

### STAGE-14 CLOSE — the trust gate, both sides on the record (2026-07-14 evening)

Fleet on 2.12.1 (healthy, toolCount 44). The retry: the IDENTICAL extraction the
morning's hand-rolled engine botched — same file, same block, same coordinates
(AbstractAstDetector.detect, the scan-report assembly), target chosen again by jawata's
own long_method detector. Result on the JDT engine behind the gate: the declared-in-
selection variable RETURNED (`Map<String, Object> scan = buildScanReport(...)`),
`compileVerified: true` from the tool itself, workspace compile 0/0, detector battery
23/23, FULL SUITE **1315/1315** — kept and committed (9dcdc98): the first refactoring of
jawata's codebase performed BY jawata. detect() remains over threshold (~100 LOC > 60);
further decomposition rides with the Sprint-25 migration. Store: 31934b12.

# PHASE 3 — Dev/sim profiling & runtime evidence (→ v2.13.x)

## C15 — D10: the profiling floor (2026-07-14)

### What shipped

Front door #2: **`profile`** — process-level diagnostics via `jcmd` (the JDK's own
Dynamic-Attach diagnostic tool, shelled out to exactly the way `JvmTargets.launch`
already shells out to `java`), against the SAME sessions `debug` opens. Six actions:
`threads` / `deadlock` / `histogram` / `gc` / `nmt` / `heap_dump`, plus `artifacts` /
`artifact_delete` sharing the Stage-7 `RuntimeArtifactStore` with `debug`.

- **`Jcmd`** (`runtime/profile/`): the shell-out + timeout + honest failure wrapper.
- **`ProfileParsers`**: turns jcmd's human-readable text into structured data —
  `Thread.print` → threads + deadlock (from the SAME dump, so the two can never
  disagree); `GC.class_histogram` → ranked, capped rows with TRUE totals alongside
  (a capped list never reads as the whole heap); `GC.heap_info` → per-region
  used/total; `VM.native_memory summary` → categories, or an honest
  `enabled: false` + why when NMT was never turned on (it cannot be, after launch).
- **`heap_dump`**: `live` (default true) dumps reachable objects only after a full
  GC — the "bounded" default; `live: false` includes unreachable garbage. Stored via
  the shared artifact store with provenance, never a bare path.
- **A stated scope boundary, not glossed over**: `profile` requires a session from
  `debug(action=launch|attach)` — reusing the Stage-7 spine rather than inventing a
  second, jcmd-only attach path. `jcmd` itself needs no JDWP agent, but attaching a
  SESSION still does; a plain non-debuggable JVM cannot be profiled today. Documented
  in the tool's own class-level Javadoc.
- **D16 (both front doors)**: the subagent hand-off clause now appears in `profile`'s
  description too, sharing the same sessionId a subagent already knows how to hold.
- **Fixture**: `DeadlockTarget.java` (debug-target project) — two daemon threads,
  opposite lock order, a fixed 500ms hold so the deadlock forms deterministically
  every run.

### A real bug, caught by the discipline this sprint adopted (not a stock guess)

Two failures on first run, both traced to source, neither explained by CPU
contention or timing (per `feedback-diagnosis-discipline-no-stock-explanations`):

1. **`DEADLOCK_HEADER` required a digit** (`\d+`). HotSpot's actual text is
   *"Found **one** Java-level deadlock:"* — the count is spelled out for the
   singular case (verified empirically with a 3-thread/1-cycle deadlock: still
   "one", because HotSpot counts CYCLES, not participants). Fixed:
   `(?:one|\d+)`.
2. **The "which is held by" phrase is on its own line**, one below "waiting to
   lock monitor ..." — never sharing a line with it, so a single-line regex could
   never match. Fixed: matched independently, paired with the last thread header
   seen; the second ("Java stack information for the threads listed above:")
   section is explicitly excluded so it cannot re-add duplicate participants.

Both root-caused from the RAW jcmd text (captured via a temporary diagnostic print,
removed once identified) — not guessed at. Stable across 3 repeated runs after the fix.

## C16 — D11: profiles that name symbols (2026-07-14)

### What shipped

**JFR actions on `profile`**: `sample` (a bounded, targeted recording —
`durationSeconds`, default 5/max 30, `settings=profile`; BLOCKS for the duration,
same "the call that waits returns the data" principle as `debug(action=wait)`),
`jfr_dump` (dump the CONTINUOUS recording the dev/sim preset already runs,
ON DEMAND, mid-run — no new sampling window), and `hotspots` (rank a JFR
artifact's methods for `dimension` = cpu | alloc | lock | gc).

- **`JfrParser`** (`runtime/profile/`): `jdk.jfr.consumer.RecordingFile` → ranked
  rows. CPU/alloc/lock are per-method rankings (top stack frame of each sample,
  symbol = `ClassName#methodName` — the SAME key `get_call_hierarchy` and
  `find_references` take, per D15's closure contract). `gc` has no Java stack to
  attribute a pause TO — it reports `pauseCount`/`totalPauseMillis`/`maxPauseMillis`
  instead of inventing a fake per-method breakdown.
- **Call counts**: each hotspot row's `samples` field IS the call-frequency
  signal — explicitly documented as sample-based (how often this method was
  caught on top of the stack), not an instrumented invocation count.
- **Pagination discipline** matches `histogram`: capped rows, TRUE
  `totalMethods`/`totalSamples` reported alongside so a capped page never reads
  as the whole recording.
- **Capability honesty (R4)**: jcmd's JFR commands answer *"Flight Recorder is
  disabled."* with exit 0 (a soft failure IN THE TEXT — verified empirically) —
  detected and reported as `enabled: false` + `why`, the same shape as `nmt`'s
  capability-absent report, never a silently empty result. R4's decision
  ("accept capability reporting with flight-recorder fallback") is satisfied by
  construction: JFR IS the fallback here, so no async-profiler integration was
  needed for this stage.
- **New fixture**: `HotLoopTarget.java` — a method that burns CPU with NO
  sleeping (unlike `DebugTarget#spin`, which sleeps between short bursts and
  would rarely be sampled), so a short window reliably ranks it #1.

### A real bug, found by reading the actual jcmd text (twice now)

Two parsing bugs in the FIRST implementation, both root-caused from the raw
tool output rather than guessed at — same discipline as C15:

1. `DEADLOCK_HEADER`-style trap avoided this time by testing empirically FIRST:
   confirmed `JFR.start`'s `duration=Ns` + `filename=` writes an EMPTY file the
   instant the recording starts, and only gets real content once the duration
   elapses — a naive "file exists" check would have raced the recording. Fixed
   by design: `sample` sleeps the full duration + a margin before reading.
2. `JFR.dump name=jawata` on a target with no such recording answers *"No
   recordings to dump from."* (exit 0) — verified empirically before writing the
   detection, not assumed from the NMT precedent's phrasing.

## C17 — D12: latency at named seams (2026-07-14)

### What shipped

**`profile(action=latency_seam)`**: className+method resolved **against the
workspace source via JDT** before the live JVM is ever touched (`SEAM_NOT_FOUND`
is a compiler-accurate refusal, not a JDI error three steps later). Traces every
call via the SAME non-suspending `method_trace` probe `debug` already uses (D8) —
reused as-is, no new instrumentation mechanism invented. Reports p50/p99/p999
TWICE: `raw` (measured) and `corrected` (coordinated-omission corrected), with
millisecond resolution stated honestly (a JDI event timestamp, not a nanosecond
instrument).

- **`LatencyCalculator`** (`runtime/profile/`): the percentile math (nearest-rank)
  and the coordinated-omission correction (Gil Tene's fix, as HdrHistogram
  implements it — for an observed value against an expected inter-call gap,
  backfill synthetic samples representing the delayed-but-real requests a
  closed-loop caller's silence hid). `expectedIntervalMillis` is either supplied
  or inferred as the MEDIAN observed gap between call starts (median, not mean —
  robust to one collection-time hiccup).
- **New fixture**: `LatencySeamTarget.java` — a CLOSED-LOOP caller (the easy,
  common shape that suffers from coordinated omission) tracing a CPU-bound seam
  with a controllable, deterministic injected tail (`-Djawata.latency.slowdown=
  true`: 1 call in 50 pays an extra 50ms — comfortably past both the p99 and
  p999 cutoffs, so both must move while p50 must not).
- **Below 200 paired samples, p999 is flagged `p999Unreliable: true`** rather than
  reported as if a handful of points were a stable measurement.

### Two real bugs, both caught by grounding, neither dismissed as flaky

**1. A floating-point boundary bug in the percentile math itself**, caught by a
DETERMINISTIC unit test built to exercise exactly this edge (999 fast calls +
one 500ms stall, hand-verified: raw p999 must land one index short of the single
slow sample). `Math.ceil(99.9 / 100.0 * 1000)` computed `999.0000000000001` —
`99.9` is not exactly representable in binary floating point, and the rounding
error pushed `Math.ceil` one full index PAST the intended boundary, landing
squarely on the one sample the test was built to keep OUT of p999. Fixed by
switching to permille (parts-per-thousand) integers with pure integer
ceiling-division — no `double` anywhere in the percentile index computation, so
no representation error to land on either side of. This is exactly the
[[feedback-diagnosis-discipline-no-stock-explanations]] discipline paying for
itself on new code, not just old: the failing assertion's exact expected-vs-actual
(`expected: <5> but was: <500>`) was read and traced to its root, not re-run or
adjusted to match.

**2. `setProbe`'s `method_trace` has no deferred-install** — unlike breakpoints
(which already bind the moment a class loads), a probe armed immediately after
`debug(action=resume)` reliably failed with `TYPE_NOT_LOADED`, because
`resume()` does not wait for anything inside the target before returning, and
the probed class (about to run `main()`) had not finished loading yet. A REAL
capability gap in Stage 10's shipped code, found by this stage's actual usage —
100% reproducible, not a timing flake. Fixed WITHOUT touching
`DebugController` (already-shipped, already-tested): the retry is contained
entirely in the new `ProfileTool` code — the exact same `setProbe` call,
retried for up to 3s while the failure is specifically `TYPE_NOT_LOADED`. A
class that genuinely never loads still fails, just not falsely, this fast.
Disclosed as a known gap for a future stage/sprint to close at the source
(extending probes to the same deferred-install machinery breakpoints already
have), rather than silently absorbed.

## C18 — D13: incident bundle on alarm (2026-07-14)

### What shipped

**`profile` actions: `incident_arm` / `incident_status` / `incident_get`
(the three-action async shape D16 named) + `jmx_read` + `log_level`.** The
alarm contract is generic and file-based: the TARGET decides something is
wrong and writes a small JSON payload (`{"symbol": "...", "reason": "..."}`)
to a path it was told about — jawata only watches for that file and
captures; it never diagnoses what "wrong" means, matching R5's division of
labor for replay (JATS owns semantics, jawata proves capture).

- **`incident_arm`** takes `sessionId` + `alarmFile` (required) + optional
  `logFile` / `live` / `jfrSliceSeconds` (default 15s), and returns an
  `incidentId` IMMEDIATELY — non-blocking, because an alarm's timing is
  exactly the one thing that cannot be scheduled for. Armed incidents are a
  bounded in-memory map (`MAX_ARMED_INCIDENTS = 50`, same discipline as the
  session registry), evicting an already-captured one if full.
- **`incident_status`** is the poll. Before the alarm file exists it reports
  `fired: false` honestly — an absence, not an error. The FIRST call after
  the file appears captures the whole bundle right there and caches it on
  the armed incident; every later poll (or a second `incident_status` call —
  tested explicitly) returns the SAME cached `artifactId`, never re-captures.
- **`incident_get`** hands back the cached summary, or refuses
  `INCIDENT_NOT_FIRED` if asked before `bundleReady`.
- **The seven-part capture** (`captureIncidentBundle`, reusing every prior
  stage's machinery — no new capture mechanism invented): JFR slice
  (`JFR.dump ... maxage=Ns` off the dev/sim preset's continuous recording),
  thread dump, heap histogram (parsed via Stage 15's `ProfileParsers`), a
  heap dump (`live`-configurable, same contract as `action=heap_dump`), a
  log slice (last 200 lines of the target's own app log, if one was
  declared), a replay descriptor (`{sessionId, target, capturedAtMillis}` —
  relaunch information, explicitly NOT an automated replay; D9's
  invariant-capture mechanism is the distinct, JATS-scoped thing that
  actually replays), and a summary that NAMES the alarming symbol
  (`alarmSymbol` / `alarmReason`, read straight from the target's own
  payload) — returned INLINE in the tool response, not just written to a
  path the caller has to go open. Each of the 7 is written under one
  artifact directory and manifested via the shared `RuntimeArtifactStore`
  (Stage 7). Any part that cannot be captured (no JFR recording, no
  `logFile` configured) is reported absent WITH a reason in `partsAbsent` —
  never silently dropped from the count.
- **`jmx_read`**: `objectName` + `attribute` over the SAME local JMX
  connection the dev/sim preset already enables (`JmxClient` — one
  `VirtualMachine.attach` → `startLocalManagementAgent` → JMX connect →
  read → always-disconnect, no new capability surface). `CompositeData`
  values (e.g. `java.lang:type=Memory`'s `HeapMemoryUsage`) are flattened
  into a plain `Map` recursively rather than returned as an opaque JMX
  type; unknown MBean/attribute are refused by name (`MBEAN_NOT_FOUND` /
  `ATTRIBUTE_NOT_FOUND`), not a generic exception.
- **`log_level`**: reads the previous level via the platform Logging MBean's
  `getLoggerLevel` operation before setting the new one, so the response
  always carries a true `previousLevel`. With `expirySeconds`, a daemon
  thread reconnects fresh after that long and reverts to the recorded
  baseline automatically — a diagnostic verbosity bump cannot outlive the
  reason it was set. Without `expirySeconds`, the change is permanent, and
  the response says so rather than implying either way.
- **New fixture**: `IncidentTarget.java` — writes its own app log every
  iteration, and at iteration 15 writes the alarm JSON (naming
  `com.example.debug.IncidentTarget#checkThreshold` as the culprit) plus an
  `ALARM:` log line, so the log slice and the alarm payload can be checked
  against each other.

### One empirical correction during grounding, caught before it became a bug

Probing the platform Logging MBean (`java.util.logging:type=Logging`)
first assumed `getLoggerNames()` would be a JMX OPERATION (it is a
no-arg method) — it failed live: `ReflectionException: No such operation:
getLoggerNames`. The JMX Standard MBean convention makes a no-arg
getter-shaped method an ATTRIBUTE, not an operation; re-probed as
`mbs.getAttribute(logging, "LoggerNames")`, which worked (17 loggers, root
`""`). `getLoggerLevel(String)` / `setLoggerLevel(String,String)` take
parameters, so they correctly stay OPERATIONS — confirmed in the same
corrected probe, including a full set → read-back → revert cycle
(INFO→FINE→INFO). Caught by testing the live MBean before writing the
product code around it, not by a failing unit test after the fact — the
same grounding discipline as Stages 15–17, applied one step earlier this
time.

## C19 — D14: native boundary triage (2026-07-14)

### What shipped

**`profile` actions: `native_hs_err` / `native_nmt` / `native_handoff`.** No
`sessionId` on any of these three — the process that crashed is gone; each
takes an `hsErrFile` path instead.

- **`HsErrParser`** (`runtime/profile/`) parses the JVM's OWN
  `hs_err_pid<pid>.log` fatal-error report. The key finding this stage rests
  on: HotSpot ALREADY correlates Java and native frames for the crashing
  thread's own stack — its "Native frames:" section interleaves `C`/`V`/`v`
  native frames with `J`/`j` Java frames, and Java frames carry a fully
  resolved method signature. No external debugger is needed to get that
  correlation; `native_hs_err` exposes it directly: `crashingThread`
  (name/state, or an honest `javaThread: false` when the signal hit a
  native/VM-internal thread instead), `nativeFrames` / `javaFrames` (each
  frame kind-classified — compiledJava/interpretedJava/vmInternal/vmStub/
  native — Java frames symbol-named `ClassName#methodName`, the SAME key
  D15's closure contract uses everywhere else; native/VM frames carry
  library+offset and a resolved function name WHERE HotSpot could resolve
  one, honestly offset-only otherwise), `problematicFrame`, `hostMemory`,
  and `coreDumpPath` (parsed from the report's own "dumping to ..." line).
- **`native_nmt`** reads the memory-tracking section EMBEDDED in the crash
  report itself (present only if the crashed JVM was launched with
  `-XX:NativeMemoryTracking=summary` — it cannot be turned on post-mortem).
  Reuses Stage 15's `ProfileParsers.parseNativeMemory` AS-IS on the embedded
  text once the section is correctly bounded (see bug 1 below) — same
  category-line shape as the live jcmd format. Absent: `enabled: false` +
  why, same shape as the live `nmt` action.
- **`native_handoff`** hands the crash to a CONFIGURED external debugger
  (`adapterCommand`, default "gdb") for a deeper backtrace than hs_err alone
  carries. Split in two by design: `GdbAdapter.isAvailable` /
  `runBacktrace` (thin, genuinely needs the tool, hard to unit-test without
  it) and `GdbAdapter.parseBacktrace` (a PURE function over gdb's own
  `thread apply all bt` text, unit-testable with a fixture transcript
  whether or not gdb is installed on the box running the test). Any gdb
  frame whose function name matches a symbol hs_err already resolved is
  marked `correlatedWithHsErr: true`. Honest about platform support (R4/D14
  wording): no configured/resolvable adapter → `available: false` + why,
  never a silent skip — and genuinely exercised as such in THIS sandbox
  (gdb is not installed here; `ulimit -c` is 0 and `core_pattern` routes to
  apport, so even an installed gdb would find no core file to analyze).
- **New fixture**: `NativeCrashTarget.java` — deterministically SIGSEGVs
  from inside a NAMED method (`triggerCrash`) via an out-of-bounds
  `sun.misc.Unsafe` write, so the hs_err file this stage's tests parse is
  exactly what HotSpot itself produces for a genuine in-process native
  crash: a real `JavaThread`, a real resolved native symbol
  (`Unsafe_PutInt+0xa4` in `libjvm.so`), and this fixture's own method name
  in the Java frames — grounded against two independently generated real
  crashes before any parser code was written (Sprint 24 diagnosis
  discipline, same as Stages 15–18).

### Three real bugs, all caught by grounding against actual generated text — none guessed

1. **The NMT section's true end is not the first blank line.** HotSpot
   inserts a "(Omitting categories weighting less than 1KB)" NOTE followed
   by ITS OWN blank line before the real `Total:` line and category
   breakdown even starts. The naive "stop at first blank line" extraction
   captured nothing but that one note line — `categories: []` on a crash
   that plainly had `-XX:NativeMemoryTracking=summary` on. Fixed: bound the
   section by the next major `---------------` divider instead (confirmed
   against the actual captured file: the section genuinely runs ~90 lines,
   header to `MallocLimit: unset`, before the next divider).
2. **A lazy-quantifier regex ambiguity silently skipped the LWP capture.**
   `\(.*?(?:LWP (?<lwp>\d+))?.*?\):\s*$` lets the engine satisfy the WHOLE
   match by treating the optional LWP group as zero-width (the trailing
   `.*?` happily swallows the literal `(LWP 5002)` text as ordinary
   characters) — `matches()` only needs ONE success, so it never backtracks
   into the position where the group would actually fire. `lwp` came back
   `null` on every thread. Fixed by NOT folding it into one pattern: a
   simple `.*` for the header shape, plus a SEPARATE `find()` for `LWP
   (\d+)` against the same line — removes the ambiguity entirely instead of
   trying to out-clever it.
3. **gdb frames end EITHER `at file:line` OR `from /path/lib.so`, never
   assumed to be only the first.** Routine calls into libc/libpthread
   (`raise`, `abort`, `pthread_cond_wait`) almost never carry debug info, so
   gdb resolves them via the dynamic symbol table and reports `from
   <library>` instead of a source location. A regex that only recognized
   `at file:line` (and required pure trailing whitespace otherwise) matched
   NEITHER shape for these frames and dropped them with no error — 3 of a
   5-frame fixture transcript vanished silently, first surfacing as
   `assertEquals(2, thread2Frames.size())` failing with `<1>`. Fixed: both
   suffixes are optional and mutually exclusive; a `library` field is
   captured when present, `file`/`line` when the other shape is.

**Plus a process trap that cost real time before any of the above was found:**
`mvn ... | tail -100 && echo "BUILD_OK"` printed success on a build that had
actually FAILED (`POM file build/pom.xml ... does not exist`, from a cwd that
had drifted since the last explicit `cd`) — a bash pipeline's exit status is
the LAST command's (`tail`'s, always 0), not `mvn`'s, so the dist jar sat
frozen mid-fix while two already-corrected bugs kept "reproducing" for real
minutes until file-mtime comparison exposed the frozen jar. Recorded in the
experience store (`b268ba59`) alongside the two hs_err/gdb domain facts
(`a15f4bc5`, `40160600`) — all three are exactly the kind of thing a future
stage would otherwise rediscover the hard way.

## C20 — D15: profile-side closure rider (2026-07-14)

### What shipped

**`ProfileClosureTest`** — the same claim `DebugClosureTest` (Stage 12)
proved for a DEBUGGER fact, proved here for a PROFILER fact: a JFR hotspot
ranking already carries a compiler-accurate symbol
(`ClassName#methodName`, Stage 16's own convention) — that symbol goes
STRAIGHT into `get_call_hierarchy` with no intermediate search. A search
would only re-derive what the profiler just measured, and could rank
something else entirely. No new product code — this stage is a proof, not
a feature; D15's measure now covers BOTH runtime doors (debug side at C12,
profile side here).

Sequence: launch `HotLoopTarget` → `profile(action=sample,
durationSeconds=3)` → `profile(action=hotspots, dimension=cpu, limit=1)` →
the top row's `symbol` (`com.example.debug.HotLoopTarget#burnCpu`) handed
directly to `GetCallHierarchyIncomingTool` → the compiler confirms `main`
as a caller, using ONLY the symbol the profiler produced.
