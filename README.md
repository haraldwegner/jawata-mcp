**GOJA lets an AI agent refactor and maintain Java *surgically* — compiler-accurate,
behaviour-preserving, and reversible in one call.** Every change runs through Eclipse JDT and the
Eclipse LTK refactoring engine (the same machinery behind the Eclipse IDE), so the agent edits
*real* code with IDE-grade guarantees instead of guessing from text — then checks it against the
compiler and can undo it instantly. That precision is what makes **fully autonomous** Java
maintenance safe: surgical improvements across an entire codebase, without the risk of a text-based
tool getting it subtly wrong.

**Why an autonomous agent can trust it**

- **Compiler-accurate** — every answer comes from Eclipse JDT's resolved model, not text matching.
  GOJA *knows* which `save()` you meant.
- **Behaviour-preserving** — refactorings pass the LTK pre/post-condition checks the IDE enforces,
  so the transformation provably preserves semantics.
- **Verified** — `compile_workspace` + `get_diagnostics` are a real compiler gate the agent runs
  after every edit.
- **Reversible** — every mutating tool returns an `undoChangeId`; one call rolls the change back.

**41 MCP tools** cover the whole loop — navigate, analyse, refactor-and-apply, detect code smells
(Fowler / SOLID / Kerievsky), apply pattern-targeted refactorings, modernise, generate, manage
dependencies (Maven + Gradle), compile the workspace, and detect + remove duplicate code.

```bash
# Linux — installs goja-studio, which fetches and runs the GOJA engine for you
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haraldwegner/goja-studio/main/install.sh | bash
```

GOJA is driven by **[goja-studio](https://github.com/haraldwegner/goja-studio)** — the desktop
control plane that downloads the engine, manages workspaces, and wires GOJA into your agent's MCP
config. macOS / Windows / manager-free setup are in **[Installation](#installation)** below.

## Why Java, why now — the renaissance

For twenty years languages trended terse — Python, then Kotlin, Scala, Go — because the cost that
mattered was *human* authoring. The agent era moves that cost: the agent writes the ceremony
tirelessly, and GOJA reads the codebase through the compiler instead of your eyes. The verbosity
tax is now paid by something that never tires — and the comprehension dividend is still yours. In
the agent era **you are the auditor, not the author**, and auditing favours explicit over clever;
that's why explicit, statically-typed Java beats terse Kotlin/Scala (harder to audit) and dynamic
Python (no compiler oracle). The types aren't ceremony — **they're the substrate GOJA stands on**:
you can't compiler-accurately refactor, prove behaviour-preservation, or detect a smell on code you
can't statically type. **GOJA is what flips Java's verbosity from liability to asset** — letting an
agent *fully engineer* Java, not merely generate it.

---

## Precision in practice

When an agent reaches for `grep` or plain file-reading to understand Java, it cannot distinguish:

- a real method call from a same-named method on an unrelated class,
- a field read from a field write,
- an interface implementation from any other reference to the type,
- a cast from any other mention of that type.

The result is wrong refactorings, missed usages, and confident-but-incorrect reasoning. GOJA drives
the same compiler the Eclipse IDE does, so the agent gets type resolution across inheritance,
method overloading/overriding, generics, classpath + import resolution, cross-bundle (OSGi)
navigation, and LTK-backed refactorings that genuinely preserve behaviour.

There is a deeper reason this works: **an agent's prior is verifiability-seeking, not
shortcut-seeking.** It grinds toward whatever it can verify — which is a liability only while
design properties are expensive to check. Make them cheap and the prior flips sign: the agent
pursues `find_field_writes = 0` with the same stubbornness it pursues green tests. That is what
compiler-accurate tooling is *for* in agent hands — it turns structural facts (writers per field,
reference audits, SOLID and smell detection) into two-minute checks, so design erosion shows up
as a number under surveillance instead of an incident in production.

| Task: find every call to `UserService.save()` | Result |
|---|---|
| `grep "save("` | 47 hits — including `orderService.save()`, `saveButton`, comments |
| GOJA `find_references` | exactly 12 — the real calls |

GOJA ships this bias with the connection itself: the MCP `instructions` field injects a trigger→tool
guide at connect, so every client is told to reach for GOJA first — not `grep`, not a hand-edit —
for anything semantic ([goja-studio](https://github.com/haraldwegner/goja-studio) adds a hard
try-first hook on top). And "understand this symbol" is one call: `analyze(kind=symbol)` returns the
definition, the type, and the references together, so there's no multi-step detour to defect from.

### Strict disk sync — every answer reflects current disk (v2.4.0)

Agents, `git checkout`, and other editors all change files outside GOJA's JVM. A staleness guard
runs once per tool call, before the tool computes anything: a millisecond scan detects external
edits by evidence (mtime/size, content hash inside the timestamp-granularity window), then exactly
the changed files are reconciled and the affected project rebuilt — only when something changed.
Search, analysis, refactor change computation, and the knowledge store's pointer judgments all
answer about the tree as of the call. There is no off switch: the only skip is the earned one —
no edit detected, no work.

Measured on this repository (~500 source files, Linux, warm):

| Case | Cost |
|---|---|
| Unchanged tree (the common case) | ~10 ms scan; tool calls total 22–28 ms |
| 1 file changed externally | ~0.03 s on the next call (reconcile + rebuild) |
| 100 files changed (branch switch shape) | ~32 ms scan + one rebuild on the next call |
| Newly loaded project (once) | one whole-project reconcile, ~4 s |

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Java 21+** on the `PATH` — the GOJA engine runs as a JVM process.

### Recommended — install goja-studio

[goja-studio](https://github.com/haraldwegner/goja-studio) is the desktop control plane. It
downloads the matching GOJA engine, manages named workspaces of Java projects, runs one resident
JVM per workspace, and writes the MCP entry into Cursor / Claude Desktop / Antigravity /
IntelliJ-style configs for you.

| Platform | Install |
|---|---|
| **Linux** (x86_64 / aarch64) | `curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haraldwegner/goja-studio/main/install.sh \| bash` — pulls the matching `.AppImage` and adds a desktop entry |
| **macOS** (Apple Silicon) | download the `.dmg` from [goja-studio releases](https://github.com/haraldwegner/goja-studio/releases/latest) (unsigned — right-click → Open once to clear Gatekeeper) |
| **Windows** (x64 / ARM64) | download the `.msi` or `-setup.exe` from [goja-studio releases](https://github.com/haraldwegner/goja-studio/releases/latest) (unsigned — one-time SmartScreen "More info → Run anyway") |

Add your Java projects in the goja-studio window (or point its autoscan at a parent folder), pick
your MCP client, and it deploys the config. Done.

### Manager-free — wire GOJA into an MCP client yourself

Prefer to run the engine directly? Download the `goja-<platform>` archive from the
[releases](https://github.com/haraldwegner/goja-mcp/releases/latest), unpack it, and launch:

```bash
./goja/goja -data /path/to/workspace-dir
```

GOJA speaks MCP over HTTP/SSE. On startup it prints a ready line with the endpoint and a
session token:

```
READY url=http://127.0.0.1:8800/mcp token=ab12cd34…
```

Point your MCP client at that URL (token in the `Authorization: Bearer` header). For a client
config block:

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "goja": {
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8800/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ab12cd34…" }
    }
  }
}
```

Define the workspace's projects by writing `<data-dir>/workspace.json` (see
[How workspaces work](#how-workspaces-work)). goja-studio automates all of this — the manual path
is for custom setups and CI.

## What GOJA does

**Multi-project workspaces.** A *workspace* is a named group of Java projects loaded into one GOJA
process and exposed as a single MCP service. The agent sees the combined symbol set of every
project; navigation, find-references, and refactorings work across the whole group. Every analysis
tool also takes an optional `projectKey` to scope down to one project.

**Live, no-restart updates.** GOJA watches `<data-dir>/workspace.json`. Add or remove a project and
the running process reconciles its project list in about a second — no process restart, no MCP
reload, no agent-session refresh.

**Every build layout, resolved correctly.** Maven, Maven-Tycho, Eclipse PDE, and Gradle (through
the Tooling API) — source roots and dependencies are resolved per layout, including OSGi
`Require-Bundle` so cross-bundle navigation just works between projects in the same workspace.

**Behaviour-preserving refactoring, applied.** Refactorings run through the Eclipse LTK engine, so
they pass the same pre/post-condition checks the IDE enforces. Every mutating tool **applies the
change by default** and returns the diff plus an `undoChangeId` — one call to reverse it. Rename,
extract, inline, move, pull-up/push-down, encapsulate-field, and change-signature all rewrite every
affected reference across the workspace.

**Verification built in.** `compile_workspace` + `get_diagnostics` give the agent a real compiler
gate to check its own edits before moving on — the post-edit loop a careful developer runs by hand.

## The tools

> Front doors consolidate many operations behind a `kind` parameter — e.g. `extract(kind)`,
> `inline(kind)`, `find_quality_issue(kind)`, `refactor_to_pattern(kind)` — so the loaded surface
> stays small (41) while the capability behind it keeps growing by registration.


**Workspace & navigation**
- *Workspace* — `load_project`, `project` *(list / add / remove)*, `refresh_workspace`
- *Navigate* — `go_to_definition`, `find_references` *(references / implementations /
  method_references)*, `get_call_hierarchy` *(incoming / outgoing)*, `inspect` *(type_hierarchy /
  document_symbols / type_members / …)*, `get_at_position` *(type / method / field / hover /
  javadoc / signature / enclosing / super / symbol)*
- *Search* — `search_symbols`, `find_pattern_usages` *(annotation / instantiation / type_argument /
  cast / instanceof)*, `find_field_writes`

**Understand**
- *Analyse* — `analyze` *(file / type / method / control_flow / data_flow / change_impact / naming /
  javadocs / nullness / symbol — one call: definition + type + references)*, `find_quality_issue` *(quality: naming / bugs / unused / large-classes /
  circular-deps / reflection / throws / catches · 18 Fowler smells · SOLID: dip / isp / srp_cohesion
  / lsp · Kerievsky: singleton / type_code — with a `family` filter: quality / fowler / solid /
  kerievsky)*
- *Inspect* — `inspect` *(complexity / project_structure / classpath / type_usage /
  dependency_graph / di_registrations)*

**Change**
- *Refactor* — `rename_symbol`, `extract` *(method / variable / constant / interface / superclass)*,
  `inline` *(method / variable)*, `move` *(class / package)*, `move_in_hierarchy` *(pull-up /
  push-down)*, `encapsulate_field`, `change_method_signature`, `convert_anonymous_to_lambda`,
  `generate` *(constructor / getters_setters / equals_hashcode / tostring / test_skeleton /
  override_methods / copy_class)* · `refactoring` *(single change: apply / undo / inspect ·
  multi-step, parity-gated: plan / apply_plan / inspect_plan / undo_plan)*
- *Multi-step orchestration* — `refactoring(action=plan → apply_plan)` walks a refactoring as
  atomic, behaviour-preserving steps with a **parity gate** (compile 0/0 + a purity check) after
  each; a broken build or a smuggled control-flow change rolls the whole plan back atomically.
  `copy_class` + `extract(kind=superclass)` are the compiler-writes-the-code primitives (copy a
  class, then lift the shared members into a parent) — reuse instead of re-authoring.
- *Refactor to patterns (Kerievsky)* — `refactor_to_pattern` *(inline_singleton / compose_method /
  replace_type_code_with_class / refactor_to_state / refactor_to_command_dispatcher /
  form_template_method / refactor_to_visitor / replace_pattern_with_idiom)* — behaviour-preserving,
  reversible, compiling; toward a pattern when complexity warrants and away from one that has
  outlived its use. OCP cure: `divergent_change` / `shotgun_surgery` point at a runnable
  `refactoring(action=plan, kind=refactor_to_state | refactor_to_command_dispatcher |
  form_template_method)`.
- *Imports & modernise* — `organize_imports`, `optimize_imports_workspace`, `find_modernization`
  *(8 idioms)*, `apply_cleanup` *(add_final / redundant_modifiers)*
- *Null-safety* — `apply_null_annotations` *(add / migrate)*
- *Format* — `format`
- *Quick fixes* — `quick_fix` *(suggest_imports / list / apply)*, `validate_syntax`
- *Duplicates* — `find_duplicate_code`, `replace_duplicates`

**Build & verify**
- *Dependencies (Maven)* — `dependency` *(add / update / find_unused)*
- *Verify* — `compile_workspace`, `get_diagnostics`, `find_tests`, `run_tests`
- *Health* — `health_check`

**Learn (knowledge store)**
- *Experience* — `experience` *(record / recall / primer / load / refresh / wipe / promote)* — the
  local, workspace-scoped knowledge store. Record a lesson / hazard / domain fact; **recall** it
  TERMINALLY for a cue (one fitting node, pointer resolved to current code, or an authoritative
  absence — never a similarity pile); prime the domain layer at session start; seed from memory
  files and keep pointers honest against the compiler.

*41 tools total; front doors (`analyze`, `inspect`, `extract`, `inline`, `move`, `generate`,
`find_quality_issue`, `find_pattern_usages`, `find_modernization`, `refactor_to_pattern`,
`dependency`, `quick_fix`, `refactoring`, `project`) each dispatch a `kind`/action, so the loaded
surface stays small while capability grows by registration.*

## How workspaces work

A workspace is described by a JSON file the engine watches:

```json
{ "version": 1, "name": "example", "projects": ["/abs/path/project-a", "/abs/path/project-b"] }
```

GOJA loads every listed project into one process and serves them as a single MCP endpoint.
`java.nio.file.WatchService` picks up edits to this file and reconciles the live project set within
about a second. goja-studio writes and maintains this file as you add and remove projects in the
UI; when running manager-free you write it yourself.

---

## Configuration

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GOJA_HTTP_PORT` | bind port for the MCP endpoint (default: auto in 8800–8999) |
| `GOJA_HTTP_TOKEN` | session token clients must present (default: generated, printed in `READY`) |
| `GOJA_DATA_DIR` | workspace data directory (location of `workspace.json`) |

goja-studio sets these per workspace automatically and allocates a stable `(port, token)` per
workspace, so multiple agents share one engine instead of spawning a JVM each.

---

## Building from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/haraldwegner/goja-mcp.git
cd goja-mcp
./mvnw clean verify          # Tycho reactor build — produces the product under org.goja.product/target
```

Requires JDK 21. The build is an Eclipse Tycho / OSGi reactor; `org.goja.product` materialises the
runnable engine for each platform.

---

## Architecture

GOJA is an OSGi application built on Eclipse JDT and the Eclipse Language Toolkit (LTK):

- **`org.goja.core`** — workspace + project model, JDT integration, the analysis/refactoring engine.
- **`org.goja.mcp`** — the MCP server: tool registry, protocol handler, HTTP/SSE transport.
- **`org.goja.launcher`** / **`org.goja.product`** — Equinox launcher and the packaged product.

One process hosts a whole workspace; tools operate on the shared JDT model, which is what makes
cross-project, compiler-accurate answers cheap.
