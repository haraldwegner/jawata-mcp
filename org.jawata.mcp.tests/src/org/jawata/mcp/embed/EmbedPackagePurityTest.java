/**
 * Sprint 27 D1 — the {@code embed} package must stay PURE: it may depend on the
 * JDK and on nothing else in jawata.
 *
 * <p>Purity is a load-bearing architectural claim, not tidiness. The dependency
 * direction {@code embed ← knowledge ← learn ← tools} is what lets the embedder
 * be tested, reasoned about and replaced in isolation, and what keeps a model
 * swap from reaching into the store or the choke. A single convenience import
 * would quietly invert it, so the rule is asserted rather than documented.</p>
 *
 * <p>The check reads the compiled CLASS FILES rather than the sources: a class
 * file's constant pool names every type the class actually references,
 * including ones used only inside method bodies, which an import-scan of the
 * source would miss entirely.</p>
