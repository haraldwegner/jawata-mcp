/**
 * Sprint 27 D2 — meaning-nearest NOMINATION over the store.
 *
 * <p>Brute-force cosine across every stored vector. At this corpus size (a few
 * thousand entries × 384 floats) that is a few milliseconds, and it is exactly
 * right: an approximate index would add a second source of "not found" that
 * nobody could distinguish from a true absence, to buy speed we do not need.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>K and the floor are VOLUME caps, never relevance decisions.</b> The
 * floor is {@link #NOMINATION_FLOOR}, derived at C0 from measured score
 * distributions rather than guessed: designated and unrelated scores OVERLAP on
 * the real corpus, so no threshold separates them and none is asked to. It sits
 * below the observed minimum of a true hit and removes only obvious noise;
 * ranking and the kind-split fit rules do the actual work. (The 0.35 that was
 * once a placeholder would have discarded a third of the true hits.)</p>
 *
 * <p>Only vectors of the CURRENT embedder identity are considered. Comparing
 * across identities would produce a number that looks like a score and means
 * nothing, so stale rows are invisible here until {@link #backfill} re-embeds
 * them.</p>
