/**
 * Sprint 27 D2 — experience returned as ANALOGY: ranked, capped, and labeled in
 * words.
 *
 * <p>Three rules from the signed ontology are enforced here, and each exists
 * because breaking it produces a specific, known harm:</p>
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Equality boosts rank; it never gates.</b> Requiring the cue's symbol
 *       or operation to match would remove every lesson learned somewhere else
 *       — which is most of them, and exactly the transfer the store is for.</li>
 *   <li><b>The basis is stated in words, never as a number.</b> "same
 *       operation" or "meaning-near" tells the agent what kind of resemblance
 *       this is, so it can judge transfer. A bare 0.42 invites treating a score
 *       as authority, and no rendering may contain one.</li>
 *   <li><b>The anchor is provenance, not a criterion.</b> An entry whose code is
 *       gone still applies — it is rendered as "learned on X, since removed",
 *       which is context, not a staleness warning. Marking it stale would tell
 *       the agent to discount knowledge that is still true.</li>
 * </ol>
