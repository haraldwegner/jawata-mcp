/**
 * Sprint 27a D1 — the single authority on whether an analogy surface speaks,
 * and how many answers it shows.
 *
 * <p><b>Judge the peak, not the score.</b> A cue that the store can actually
 * answer produces one entry standing clear of that cue's OWN typical score; a
 * cue it cannot answer produces a flat profile where nothing does. The
 * background is a free by-product of the brute-force scan that already runs,
 * and before this class it was computed and thrown away.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Why an absolute bar cannot do this job.</b> Stage 0 measured every
 * candidate over 2,040 live entries: {@code top1}, z-score, gap-to-next,
 * {@code top1/p99} and peakiness ALL overlap between cues that must speak and
 * cues that must stay silent. Four nonsense controls beat the weakest true cue
 * on {@code top1}, z-score AND gap simultaneously, so no monotone rule over
 * those statistics can admit the one and reject the others. Standing clear of
 * the cue's own background is the only measured separator — hence this class,
 * and hence {@link EmbeddingIndex#NOMINATION_FLOOR} keeping its original,
 * different job (a volume cap for fact nomination) and losing this one.</p>
 *
 * <p>PURE by construction: a profile in, an ordered decision out. No store, no
 * embedder, no rendering — so it is exhaustively testable, and so the rule
 * cannot quietly differ between the four surfaces that consult it.</p>
