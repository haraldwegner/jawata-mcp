/**
 * Sprint 21 Stage 2 — the two-phase, fit-gated, <em>terminal</em> retrieval contract
 * (recall-gap design notes §7). A cue resolves to a closed, scope-filtered set of fitting
 * nodes (pointers resolved to current code through JDT) OR an authoritative absence —
 * never a similarity-ranked pile the agent must sift.
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Phase 1 (fuzzy gather):</b> {@link ExperienceStore#query} keyword/alias-matches
 *       any present cue over the indexed columns + the symptom child table. Deterministic
 *       (LIKE/normalize) — embeddings are Sprint 27, behind this same gate.</li>
 *   <li><b>Phase 2 (fit gate):</b> keep only candidates whose scope <em>contains</em> the
 *       cue (symbol equal/enclosing, package equal/enclosing, operation equal, symptom
 *       alias-match). A candidate that merely surfaced in Phase 1 but does not contain the
 *       cue is dropped — that is the denoising step.</li>
 *   <li><b>Terminal:</b> 0 fitting → {@code absence}; ≥1 → the fit set ordered by
 *       scope-specificity › confidence › recency, each pointer JDT-resolved (or flagged
 *       stale). The single most-specific node is the head; callers wanting ≤1 (the advisor)
 *       take the head.</li>
