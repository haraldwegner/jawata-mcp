/**
 * Sprint 27a D9 — matching on WORDS, scored by how rare they are.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this exists.</b> The store's older word-matching required every
 * token of a cue to appear as a substring of a row's summary or one of its
 * symptoms, joined by AND, un-stopworded and unscored, with the row's body
 * never searched. On the cue "our test coverage looked like it fell from 77% to
 * 34% overnight" the token {@code looked} alone takes 2,080 rows to zero. That
 * path answers 2 of the 12 frozen calibration cues.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>What rarity buys.</b> The entry that answers that cue shares four rare
 * words with it — {@code fell} occurs in 6 of 2,080 rows, {@code 77} in 16,
 * {@code 34} in 33, {@code overnight} in 25. Weighted by rarity it ranks
 * <b>1st of 2,080</b>; the meaning path ranks it 28th, because averaging a
 * 300-word note into one 384-number vector dissolves exactly that rarity.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>And why this does NOT replace meaning-matching.</b> Measured alone
 * against the frozen contract it scores 3 of 12, against the meaning path's 9.
 * The two fail on DIFFERENT cues, which is the whole reason both run and their
 * rankings are merged — see {@link AnalogyPolicy#nominate(Map, Map)}. A word
 * matcher cannot see that "bet against a stock" is a short position; a vector
 * cannot see that two texts share the same four rare tokens.</p>
 *
 * <p>No stop-word list, deliberately: inverse document frequency already drives
 * words like "the" and "our" to near zero, and a hand-maintained list is one
 * more thing to be wrong about this corpus.</p>
 *
 * <p>PURE: rows in, scores out. No store, no connection, no embedder.</p>

     * such words toward zero on a large corpus — but "toward zero" is not zero,
     * and on a SMALL one it fails outright, because rarity cannot be estimated
     * from a handful of documents. Against a store holding a single row, the
     * word "the" has df = 1 of n = 1 and scores 0.2877 as though it were rare.

     * document-frequency distribution was fitted to pick it; the argument is
     * that a word carried by most rows cannot discriminate between them, and a
     * majority is the natural place to put that line. Its COST is real and
     * pinned by test: on a corpus of one row nothing matches by words at all,
     * and on a handful of rows only terms unique to one of them do. That is
     * acceptable because a near-empty store has no rarity to estimate and the
     * meaning path carries recall there — but it is a limit, not a free
