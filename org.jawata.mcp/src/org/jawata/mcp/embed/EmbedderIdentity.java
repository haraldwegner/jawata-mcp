 * What produced a vector: model, dimension and pipeline version.
 *
 * <p>Every stored vector carries one. The rule it exists to enforce is
 * absolute: <b>vectors of different identities are never compared.</b> Cosine
 * between two embedding spaces is not a small error, it is a meaningless
 * number that still looks like a score — it would rank, sort and pass a floor
 * exactly like a real one, so nothing downstream could notice. Comparing them
 * must be impossible rather than discouraged, which is why
 * {@link #requireComparable} throws instead of returning a boolean nobody is
 * obliged to check.</p>
 *
 * <p>{@code version} is ours, not the model's: it changes when OUR pipeline
 * changes in a way that moves vectors (tokenizer fix, pooling change, a
 * different precision that failed parity) even though the checkpoint is
 * identical. An identity change triggers the one-time corpus re-embed, mirroring
 * how {@code LOADER_VERSION} self-heals the knowledge store.</p>
 *
 * @param model the checkpoint, e.g. {@code sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2}
 * @param dim   the vector dimension
 * @param version our pipeline version
