/**
 * Sprint 17 (Fowler) — <b>Shotgun Surgery</b>. The structural dual of Divergent
 * Change: where Divergent Change is one class touched for many reasons, Shotgun
 * Surgery is one change that ripples across many classes. Proxy: a <em>concrete</em>
 * type referenced from more than {@code threshold} distinct other types (default
 * 10) — a change to its surface forces edits in all of them. Pointed refactoring:
 * <b>Move Method/Field</b> (gather the scattered responsibility) / Inline Class.
 *
 * <p>v1.3.1 recalibration (dogfood): <b>interfaces and abstract classes are
 * skipped</b> — they are abstractions and are <em>meant</em> to be depended on
 * widely (that's DIP, not a smell; flagging IJdtService/Detector/Tool was noise),
 * and the default threshold was raised 5 → 10.</p>
