/**
 * Sprint 24 (D10) — the {@code profile} front door: process-level diagnostics
 * against a running JVM, without needing it to be a debug target.
 *
 * <p><b>How this differs from {@code debug}.</b> The interactive debugger talks
 * JDWP, which only exists on a JVM that was STARTED with a debug agent — a
 * structural, permanent decision (see {@code JvmTargets.NotDebuggable}). {@code
 * jcmd}, which this tool uses, needs none of that: it attaches to any same-user
 * JVM through the JDK's Dynamic Attach mechanism. Threads, heap, GC and native
 * memory are OS/JVM-process facts, not debug-channel facts.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Scope of this stage.</b> This tool operates against the SAME sessions
 * {@code debug} does — {@code debug(action=launch|attach)} first, then the
 * {@code sessionId} it returns. That is a real, stated boundary: today, attaching
 * a session still requires the target to be JDWP-debuggable, even though {@code
 * jcmd} itself would work on a plain JVM. Reusing the Stage-7 session spine
 * (rather than inventing a second, jcmd-only attach path) keeps one lifecycle,
 * one artifact store, and one handle an agent hands to a subagent — and a
 * dev/sim-preset target is debuggable AND profilable at once, which is the
 * common case this stage serves.</p>

            Process-level diagnostics for a running JVM — threads, deadlocks, heap,
            GC state, native memory, heap dumps. Works on any session from
            debug(action=launch|attach); does not require or change debuggability.

            USAGE: profile(action="<action>", sessionId="<from debug launch|attach>", ...)

            - threads    — every OS thread the JVM knows about: name, id, daemon,
                           state, and its Java stack (bounded by maxFrames, default 20).
                           A process-level dump — it works even mid-breakpoint, unlike
                           debug(action=threads) which reads the suspended JDI view.
            - deadlock   — from the SAME dump `threads` would read, so the two can never
                           disagree. `deadlocked: false` when there is none — an absence
                           is an answer. When there IS one, the summary NAMES the wait
                           chain (who blocks whom), not just the raw thread list.
            - histogram  — the heap's class histogram, ranked by retained bytes, capped
                           at `limit` (default 20, max 200) — with the TRUE total class
                           count and totals reported alongside, so a capped list never
                           reads as the whole heap.
            - gc         — current heap/generation sizes (used/total per region) plus
                           Metaspace — a snapshot, not a trend; call it again to see one.
            - nmt        — native memory summary by category (reserved/committed). If
                           the target was not launched with -XX:NativeMemoryTracking
                           (it cannot be turned on after the fact), this says so plainly
                           — `enabled: false` and why — never a fabricated all-zero report.
            - heap_dump  — a full HPROF heap dump, ARTIFACT-STORED with provenance.
                           `live` (default true) dumps only reachable objects after a
                           full GC — usually far smaller and what you want for "what's
                           actually retained"; `live: false` includes unreachable
                           garbage too, for the rare case that matters.

            PROFILES THAT NAME SYMBOLS — Java Flight Recorder, parsed and ranked:
            - sample     — a BOUNDED, targeted recording: `durationSeconds` (default 5,
                           max 30) of CPU/allocation/lock sampling at the "profile" JFC
                           template's rate, artifact-stored when it completes. BLOCKS
                           for the duration — the call that waits is the call that
                           returns the data, same as debug(action=wait).
            - jfr_dump   — dump the CONTINUOUS recording the dev/sim preset already
                           runs (name "jawata"), ON DEMAND, mid-run — no new sampling
                           window, whatever it already captured. Refused, honestly, if
                           the target has no such recording (not preset-launched, or
                           Flight Recorder is disabled — `enabled: false` + why, same
                           shape as `nmt`'s capability-absent report).
            - hotspots   — rank a JFR artifact's methods for `dimension` = cpu | alloc
                           | lock | gc. cpu/alloc/lock are PER-METHOD rankings (the top
                           stack frame of each sample) — symbol-named
                           (`ClassName#methodName`, the same key get_call_hierarchy and
                           find_references take), paginated (`offset`/`limit`, default
                           20 max 200), with the TRUE total sample and method counts
                           reported alongside so a capped page never reads as the whole
                           picture. `samples` on each row is a SAMPLE count — how often
                           this method was caught on top of the stack — not an
                           instrumented call count; said plainly, not implied. `gc` has
                           no Java stack to rank a method BY (a GC pause is a fact about
                           the collector), so it reports pauseCount/totalPauseMillis/
                           maxPauseMillis instead of inventing an attribution JFR does
                           not provide.

            LATENCY AT A NAMED SEAM:
            - latency_seam — className + method: a JDT-RESOLVED seam (checked against
                           the WORKSPACE source before touching the live JVM — a wrong
                           name is refused with a compiler-accurate reason, not a JDI
                           error three steps later). Traces every call via the SAME
                           non-suspending method_trace probe `debug` uses (D8) — the
                           program is never stopped — for `durationSeconds` (default 5,
                           max 30; the call BLOCKS for it). Reports p50/p99/p999 TWICE:
                           `raw` (measured) and `corrected` (coordinated-omission
                           corrected — see below), millisecond resolution, stated as
                           such (this is a JDI event timestamp, not a nanosecond
                           instrument).

                           WHY TWO SETS OF PERCENTILES: most latency measurements are
                           CLOSED-LOOP — the next call starts only after the last one
                           finishes (this is the easy thing to build, and it is what
                           this stage's own fixture does). A closed-loop caller SKIPS
                           the calls a real, open-loop caller would still have issued
                           during a slow patch — so its raw trace under-reports its own
                           tail, worse the slower the stall. `corrected` backfills the
                           samples that silence hid (Gil Tene's fix, as HdrHistogram
                           implements it: for an observed value v against the expected
                           inter-call gap i, add phantom samples at v-i, v-2i, ... down
                           to i). Both numbers are reported so the correction's effect
                           is VISIBLE, never asserted. `expectedIntervalMillis` — pass it
                           if you know the target's intended call rate; omitted, it is
                           INFERRED as the median gap between observed call starts.
                           Below 200 paired samples, p999 is flagged as unreliable
                           rather than reported as if it were not.

            ARTIFACTS: artifacts / artifact_delete — heap dumps, JFR recordings (and
            anything debug produced) with provenance and an expiry; explicit delete,
            because these get large. Shares the store with `debug` — one place either
            front door can find what a session left behind.

            RARE OR LONG-RUNNING WATCHES: hand the sessionId to a SUBAGENT — the same
            handle debug(action=wait) hands off, so one session serves both doors
            without re-attaching.
