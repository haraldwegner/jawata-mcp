/**
 * Sprint 24 (D2) — <b>stale memory repairs itself</b>. The human loop is: go
 * where you think it is; on a miss, search; when the search finds it elsewhere,
 * REPLACE the stale memory with the finding. An agent addressing a symbol by
 * name (its stable memory key) should get that whole loop in ONE call, not a
 * bare "not found" that costs a second round trip and leaves the repair
 * undone.
 *
 * <p>So a name that no longer resolves is answered with the indexed best-guess
 * relocation in the SAME response — "not there; found here", explicitly flagged
 * as a correction ({@code SYMBOL_RELOCATED}).</p>
 *
 * <p><b>The correction is never acted upon.</b> The call still fails: silently
 * retargeting a refactoring at a symbol the caller did not name would be far
 * worse than a failed call. The agent re-issues once with the corrected name —
 * one hop, and its memory is now right.</p>
