/**
 * What a whole-project scan actually managed to look at — and the refusal to pretend
 * otherwise.
 *
 * <p><b>The bug this exists to kill.</b> Every scanning tool in jawata used to walk the
 * project like this:</p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * for (Path file : service.getAllJavaFiles()) {
 *     ICompilationUnit cu = service.getCompilationUnit(file);
 *     if (cu == null) continue;          // <-- silently skipped
 *     ...
 * }
 * return "found 0 problems";             // <-- a statement about files we never opened
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>{@code getCompilationUnit} returns null when the underlying JDT lookup FAILS — a
 * {@code JavaModelException} while the Java model is rebuilding, an unresolved classpath —
 * because the core swallows that exception. So under load a tool could skip every file it
 * listed and still answer "nothing found", which is not an absence but a <b>failure to
 * look</b>. It showed up as "flaky" tests that went green on a re-run, and a re-run is
 * exactly how a lying tool stays hidden.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>The contract.</b> We LISTED the files ourselves, so if we listed N and read fewer,
 * that gap IS the failure, whatever caused it. Therefore:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>every response says what it examined ({@code filesListed} / {@code filesExamined}),
 *       so a zero can never be read as a clean bill of health;</li>
 *   <li>a scan that examined <b>nothing</b> is REFUSED — it has no verdict to give;</li>
 *   <li>a scan that missed <b>some</b> files reports its findings AND the gap, because real
 *       findings are worth having and a partial picture must not pass for the whole one.</li>
 * </ul>
