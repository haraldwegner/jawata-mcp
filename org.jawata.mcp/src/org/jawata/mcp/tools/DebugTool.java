            Interactive debugging of a local JVM — attach to a running program, or
            launch one, and work with it live.

            USAGE: debug(action="<action>", ...)

            - discover — the local JVMs, each flagged `debuggable` or not. A JVM that
                         started WITHOUT a debug agent can never be given one, so it can
                         never be attached to — that is a fact of the JVM, not a policy.
            - attach   — attach to one. Needs: pid. Refuses, with the reason, if the
                         target was not started debuggable. Returns a sessionId and what
                         the JVM can actually do.
            - launch   — start a JVM under the dev/sim preset, attached and HELD BEFORE ITS
                         FIRST INSTRUCTION. Arm breakpoints, then action=resume to start
                         the program — otherwise it has already run past what you wanted
                         to see. Needs: mainClass + classpath. Optional: args, jvmArgs,
                         workingDirectory.
            - status   — one session, or all of them (omit sessionId).
            - detach   — end a session. A JVM you LAUNCHED is killed; a JVM you
                         ATTACHED to is released and keeps running — it was never
                         yours.
            - cancel   — alias for detach.

            BREAKPOINTS (all need sessionId):
            - breakpoint_set   — kind = line | method | conditional | hit_count |
                                 exception | field_access | field_write.
                                 Needs className; plus line (line/conditional/hit_count),
                                 method (method), field (the two field kinds),
                                 condition (conditional), hitCount (hit_count).
                                 A class that is not loaded YET does not fail — the
                                 breakpoint is deferred and reports `bound: false` with
                                 the reason, and binds the moment the class loads.
            - breakpoint_list / breakpoint_clear — as they read.

            STOPPING AND LOOKING:
            - wait     — BLOCK until the next breakpoint hit, and return it. Returns the
                         instant it fires; if nothing fires, waits up to timeoutMillis
                         (default 30s, max 240s) and then answers "nothing yet" — which is
                         an answer, not an error.

                         NOTHING IS EVER MISSED. A hit SUSPENDS the thread and leaves it
                         suspended: the program stops and waits for you, indefinitely. So
                         a wait that times out loses nothing — call again and the hit is
                         still there. (This is why no push notification is needed, and why
                         one would not help: an agent only ever runs on tool results.)

                         WAITING FOR SOMETHING RARE — a condition that takes an hour, a
                         bug that shows up on the ten-thousandth message? Hand the session
                         to a SUBAGENT: it arms the breakpoints, starts the program, and
                         loops `wait` in its own context while the main loop does other
                         work. The sessionId is the whole handle it needs.
            - threads  — every thread and what it is doing. A RUNNING thread reports NO
                         stack and says why: a stack read from a running thread is a
                         race, not a reading.
            - snapshot — one SUSPENDED thread: stack, and one frame's arguments, locals
                         and `this`, expanded to bounds you set (depth / maxItems /
                         maxBytes). Every bound that bites is reported on the node it
                         truncated — a silently truncated object graph reads like a
                         complete one.
            - evaluate — a Java expression in a suspended frame, INCLUDING calling
                         methods on the target's own objects. An expression form this
                         evaluator does not implement is refused BY NAME rather than
                         quietly evaluated as something else.
            - instances— live instances of a type, paged. Past the enumeration cap the
                         exact count comes from the JVM's heap histogram — a cap
                         reported as a count would be a lie with a number on it.

            MOVING ON:
            - step     — mode = in | over | out | to_line (to_line needs className+line).
                         The thread runs; poll `wait` for where it lands.
            - resume   — one thread (threadId), or every suspended thread.

            TESTING A HYPOTHESIS — changing the running program to see what happens:
            - set_value    — overwrite a local or a field. Needs threadId, name, expression
                             ("what if this were 0?").
            - force_return — abandon the current method and return a value to its caller NOW.
                             The rest of the method does not run — side effects included.
            - pop_frame    — put the thread back at the call site, about to make the call
                             again. Rewinds the STACK, not the world: side effects the frame
                             already had are still done.
            - redefine     — replace a class's bytecode (needs className + classFile). Method
                             BODIES only — adding or removing a method or field is refused,
                             plainly. Methods already on the stack keep their old code until
                             re-entered.
            - mutations    — everything this session changed, in order.

            WATCHING WITHOUT STOPPING — probes (this is what you use on a live simulation,
            where suspending the world is exactly what you cannot do):
            - probe_set   — kind = field_watch (every read and write of a field) |
                            method_trace (entry and exit, with the RETURN VALUE) |
                            logpoint (a line, optionally capturing expressions).
                            The program KEEPS RUNNING at full speed. Optional budget
                            (default 1000 events), after which the probe stops itself and
                            says so — a probe on a hot path would otherwise stream forever.
            - probe_read  — the values it has streamed. They also land in `hitStream`, so a
                            file monitor gets them as they happen.
            - probe_list / probe_clear — as they read.

            THE ONE HONEST CATCH: a JDI event carries only what the JVM puts in it. A field's
            value and a method's return value are FREE — they ride in the event, and nothing
            stops. But LOCALS can only be read from a stopped thread, so a logpoint with
            `capture` DOES stop the thread on every pass, reads the frame, and lets it go.
            Such a probe reports `perturbs: true`.

            AND IT IS NOT CHEAP. Each captured expression is a round trip to the JVM, and an
            expression that CALLS A METHOD costs a real method invocation in the target. On a
            hot path the thread can end up stopped for a large fraction of its time — that is
            not "a few microseconds", it is a different program. If you are hunting a race or
            a timing bug, this will hide it or invent it: use field_watch or method_trace,
            which stop nothing at all.

            ONCE YOU MUTATE, IT IS NOT THE SAME PROGRAM. A conclusion drawn after a mutation
            is a conclusion about a program you edited. `mutations` is how you (and whoever
            reads your report) can tell which is which — so use it, and say what you changed.

            REPLAY WITH AN INVARIANT — the one that finds the bug for you:
            - replay — launch a program, declare what must ALWAYS be true, and stop at the
                       FIRST moment it is not. Needs: mainClass, classpath, invariant (a
                       boolean Java expression), className + line (where to check it).
                       Optional: capture (expressions to record), args, timeoutMillis.

                       The invariant is armed as its own negation, so the program runs at
                       speed and stops only when it is actually broken. What comes back is
                       the FIRST violation — stack, locals, and your captured expressions —
                       stored as an artifact with its provenance. The thread is left
                       SUSPENDED right there, so you can snapshot, evaluate and step from
                       the exact moment things went wrong, not from the wreckage afterwards.

                       If the invariant HELD for the whole run, it says so — which is an
                       answer, not a failure.

            ARTIFACTS: artifacts / artifact_delete — what a session left behind (replay
            captures, dumps), with provenance and an expiry. Explicit delete, because
            these get large.

            CLOSING THE LOOP: a hit names the class and the method, and that IS the key the
            static tools take — symbol="com.example.Foo#bar" goes straight into
            get_call_hierarchy / find_references / analyze. Never search for something the
            running program has just told you.

            ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
            WHAT THIS DOES TO THE TARGET — read this once.

            1. A debug session SUSPENDS THREADS AND CHANGES STATE in the JVM it is attached
               to. Breakpoints stop it; set_value, force_return, pop_frame and redefine
               rewrite it. This is not observation — it is intervention.

            2. It is meant for a DEVELOPMENT OR SIMULATION machine. That is not a
               disclaimer, it is the design: a JVM can only be debugged if it was STARTED
               with a debug agent, and one cannot be added later. A production JVM that was
               not launched for debugging is not protected by policy — it is unreachable.

            3. Where a JVM *is* debuggable — a test or staging box, say — pointing this at
               it is YOUR PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT, and jawata will not second-guess it. If
               you do not know what suspending that JVM would do, that is the answer.
