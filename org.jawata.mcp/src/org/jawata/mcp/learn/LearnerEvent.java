 * file — never batched, never waiting for an offline cycle.

 *     transport; {@code "local"} for direct/in-process calls)
 * @param kind one of the {@code KIND_*} constants
 * @param tool the tool whose call produced the signal
 * @param detailJson free-form JSON detail (small — counts, flags, file lists)
