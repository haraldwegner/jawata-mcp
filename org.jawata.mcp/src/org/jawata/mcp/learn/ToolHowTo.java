/**
 * v3.3.1: the one-line HOW-TO the precedent push carries (Sprint 26a D2 body —
 * the injector "surfaces the precedent (with the how-to)"). v3.3.0 named the
 * tool and the agreement count but never said how to drive it, so a pushed
 * precedent read as a bare name; an external code review against the signed
 * spec caught the gap.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately ONE line per tool, phrased to match the D1 catalog delivered
 * at initialize ({@code McpProtocolHandler.SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS}) so the two
 * cannot drift into contradicting each other. An uncatalogued tool yields
 * {@code null}: the hint is ADDITIVE, and its absence never suppresses the
 * precedent itself.</p>
