/**
 * Composes the WEIGHTED precedent steer (Sprint 26a, D2) from retrieved
 * {@link ToolExperience} rows — or {@code null} when they carry no clear
 * signal. Pure function of its inputs (no store, no I/O), so it is trivially
 * decoupled from the retriever: Sprint 27's embedding retriever feeds the SAME
 * compose. The weight is agreement — how many similar past cases pointed the
 * same way.
 *
 * <p>The high-value case is a NEGATIVE precedent (a tool that reverted/errored
 * in a similar case): surfaced with a justification-cost to defect. A consistent
 * POSITIVE precedent is surfaced as lighter reinforcement; a single positive is
 * not enough to push. Either way the steer carries the named tool's one-line
 * how-to ({@link ToolHowTo}) — a precedent the agent cannot act on is a name,
 * not a steer.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>v3.3.1 scope note:</b> composing the cost is this class's whole job —
 * the WORDED cost lives here, the ENFORCEMENT (refusing an unjustified defection)
 * lives at the choke. Until that lands, do not describe this as "the guard's
 * mechanism, extended": an external review against the signed spec caught
 * exactly that over-claim in v3.3.0.</p>
